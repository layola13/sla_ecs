# sla_ecs Current Plan — Bevy ECS Parity (per-dimension)

Last updated: 2026-07-14

## Overall Status
- Per-dimension completion (see README.md "Bevy ECS Parity Assessment"): API surface parity ~94–96%, behavioral parity ~86–91%. Not 100%: full TaskPool/Scope-style worker scheduling and full runtime reflection remain incomplete (see README ⚠️ / ❌).
- Counts (measured 2026-07-09): 270 lib `.sla` modules; 174 `tests/*.sla` files; 90 `examples/*.sla`; 4,130 source `.sla` `@test` annotations across lib/tests/examples. Historical isolated-test batch total remains separately tracked in `progress.md` for older isolated batches.
- Tests verified on the SA backend; focused Batches 112–167 also pass representative default backend suites after the Batch 122 hash-map refs unblocker and the later SAB call-target/thread-function-pointer fixes, except large/import-heavy whole-file paths that are explicitly documented as compiler-size/cleanup issues. Batch 167's executor run-condition fold path passes generated SA and default backend with 98 isolated tests. Current ECS completion evidence should prefer generated SA (`--test-backend sa`) unless a task explicitly targets SAB behavior; SAB findings are reported to compiler docs rather than fixed directly in this stream.
- Every bevy_ecs module has isolated parity tests covering its public API surface, except the two genuinely incomplete areas noted above.

42. Multi-threaded executor initial debug-stepping skip facade: `ecs_executor_run_plan_apply_initial_skips` marks skipped systems completed, removes them from ready, and signals dependents before normal run-plan driving, matching Bevy `_skip_systems` startup behavior (32 executor isolated tests pass generated SA and default backend)
43. Multi-threaded executor active-running can-run gates: `ecs_executor_state_can_spawn_system`, `ecs_executor_run_plan_next_runnable`, and spec-aware completion now model Bevy's active exclusive/local scheduling gates and clear running flags after completion (35 executor isolated tests pass generated SA and default backend)
44. Multi-threaded executor failed set-condition pending skip: `ecs_executor_run_plan_apply_failed_set_condition` models Bevy set-condition failure by marking systems skipped/evaluated without completing them until they become ready, then releasing dependents through the normal skip path (38 executor isolated tests pass generated SA and default backend)
45. Multi-threaded executor passed set-condition evaluated path: `ecs_executor_run_plan_apply_passed_set_condition` marks a successful set condition evaluated without skips/completion/dependency release and prevents later re-evaluation for that set (40 executor isolated tests pass generated SA and default backend)
46. Multi-threaded executor failed system-condition pending skip: `ecs_executor_run_plan_apply_failed_system_condition` marks only the current system skipped without touching evaluated sets or releasing dependents until the skipped system becomes ready (43 executor isolated tests pass generated SA and default backend)
47. Multi-threaded executor running-conflict can-run gates: `EcsExecutorSystemSpec` now carries set-condition, system-condition, and access conflict metadata, and `ecs_executor_state_can_spawn_system` blocks candidates with conflicting running systems while still allowing pending-skipped systems to release dependents (46 executor isolated tests pass generated SA and default backend)
48. Multi-threaded executor exclusive `ApplyDeferred` barrier path: `ecs_executor_system_spec_as_apply_deferred` serializes a barrier as exclusive/local, applies and clears prior unapplied systems, then leaves only the barrier itself unapplied after completion (48 executor isolated tests pass generated SA and default backend)
49. Multi-threaded executor ready rescan after skip: `ecs_executor_run_plan_take_ready_batch` now removes selected systems from ready and rescans after skipped systems notify dependents, matching Bevy `spawn_system_tasks` immediate recheck behavior (49 executor isolated tests pass generated SA and default backend)
50. Multi-threaded executor selected-running spawn-loop behavior: ready-batch selection now marks systems running immediately, so later candidates in the same Bevy-style spawn loop see selected-system access/local/exclusive gates; one non-exclusive local system may share a batch with send systems while blocking other local systems (52 executor isolated tests pass generated SA and default backend)
51. Multi-threaded executor completed-dependent signal guard: dependency release now only marks a dependent ready if it is not already completed, matching Bevy `signal_dependents`'s completed-system guard and preventing initial-skip/debug-skip edge cases from re-readying completed systems (54 executor isolated tests pass generated SA and default backend)
52. Multi-threaded executor begin-run reset path: `EcsExecutorRunPlan` stores original dependency counts and `ecs_executor_run_plan_begin_run` resets per-run state to Bevy `MultiThreadedExecutor::run` startup semantics while preserving existing unapplied buffers (56 executor isolated tests pass generated SA and default backend)
53. Multi-threaded executor deferred-system apply timing: ordinary systems with deferred buffers remain in `unapplied_systems` after completion and are flushed by explicit `ApplyDeferred` barriers or final cleanup, matching Bevy `finish_system_and_handle_dependents` / `apply_deferred` timing (57 executor isolated tests pass generated SA and default backend)
54. Multi-threaded executor all-completed unapplied tracking: every completed system, including systems without actual deferred buffers, remains in `unapplied_systems` until an `ApplyDeferred` barrier or final cleanup iterates the set, matching Bevy's unconditional completion tracking (58 executor isolated tests pass generated SA and default backend)
55. Multi-threaded executor panic/error completion payload path: system-result payloads and deferred-apply payloads are recorded with phase/system markers, ordinary completion still marks completed/unapplied and signals dependents, `ApplyDeferred` barrier errors clear the cloned snapshot before completion, and final deferred cleanup clears `unapplied_systems` before the pending payload is taken for the modeled rethrow point (61 executor isolated tests pass generated SA and default backend)
56. Multi-threaded executor handled-error completion path: handled system/deferred errors record counters and last phase/system without setting a pending panic payload, ordinary completion still marks completed/unapplied and signals dependents, and deferred handled-error barrier/final-cleanup paths continue applying every unapplied system, matching Bevy `handle_errors` returning `Ok(())` after invoking the error handler (64 executor isolated tests pass generated SA and default backend)
57. Multi-threaded executor individual completion queue path: `ecs_executor_run_plan_complete_running_system` completes one running system independently of ready-batch order, preserving other running systems and local/exclusive flags while immediately marking the completed system unapplied and signaling dependents, matching Bevy's `system_completion` queue draining into `finish_system_and_handle_dependents` (66 executor isolated tests pass generated SA and default backend)
58. Multi-threaded executor tick completion-drain path: `ecs_executor_run_plan_drain_completion_queue` and `ecs_executor_run_plan_tick_with_completions` drain all completed systems before ready-batch spawning, so newly released dependents can spawn in the same modeled tick while still respecting conflicts with systems that remain running, matching Bevy `ExecutorState::tick` ordering (68 executor isolated tests pass generated SA and default backend)
59. Multi-threaded executor `tick_executor` outer-loop recheck path: `ecs_executor_run_plan_tick_executor_with_completion_waves` always performs an initial modeled tick and repeats when completion waves remain after the modeled lock-release queue check, covering first-tick empty completion spawning and a refill/recheck round that unblocks a dependent after a remaining running conflict clears (70 executor isolated tests pass generated SA and default backend)
60. Multi-threaded executor `Context::system_completed` tick handoff path: `ecs_executor_run_plan_system_completed_tick_executor`, `ecs_executor_run_plan_system_panic_payload_completed_tick_executor`, and `ecs_executor_run_plan_system_handled_error_completed_tick_executor` combine completion queue push, payload/handled-error recording, and immediate tick-executor reentry so newly released dependents can spawn from the same modeled handoff (73 executor isolated tests pass generated SA and default backend)
61. Multi-threaded executor `Context::tick_executor` try-lock failure path: `EcsExecutorTickLoopResult` now records `pending_completions` and `lock_failed`, and the `*_completed_tick_executor_lock_failed` facades model Bevy's `try_lock().ok()?` early return where the completion queue push and payload/handled-error bookkeeping happen, but no completion drain, dependent release, or new ready-batch spawn occurs on that thread (76 executor isolated tests pass generated SA and default backend)
62. Multi-threaded executor `Context::system_completed` finish-run closure path: completed `ApplyDeferred` barriers now have focused tick-handoff coverage proving prior unapplied systems are flushed before dependent spawn, and panic/handled-error handoffs have finish-run coverage proving final deferred cleanup happens before the modeled final payload take/rethrow point (79 executor isolated tests pass generated SA and default backend)
63. Multi-threaded executor `ApplyDeferred` completed-tick deferred error path: `ecs_executor_run_plan_apply_deferred_panic_payload_completed_tick_executor` and `ecs_executor_run_plan_apply_deferred_handled_error_completed_tick_executor` model Bevy's barrier task applying the cloned unapplied snapshot, recording deferred apply panic/handled-error state, then pushing completion and reentering `tick_executor` so the barrier completes and releases dependents in the same handoff (81 executor isolated tests pass generated SA and default backend)
64. Multi-threaded executor non-`ApplyDeferred` exclusive completed-tick handoff path: exclusive systems are now treated as implicitly local/non-send in the run-plan model, and explicit `ecs_executor_run_plan_exclusive_system_*_completed_tick_executor` facades cover normal, panic-payload, handled-error, and try-lock-failed handoffs without accidentally applying prior unapplied systems before an `ApplyDeferred` barrier or final cleanup (84 executor isolated tests pass generated SA and default backend)
65. Multi-threaded executor run-end disabled-final-deferred panic/handled-error path: system panic-payload and handled-error handoffs now have focused coverage through `MultiThreadedExecutor::run` cleanup when `apply_final_deferred=false`, proving unapplied systems are preserved, deferred apply errors are not recorded, transient state is cleared, and payload/no-rethrow semantics remain intact (86 executor isolated tests pass generated SA and default backend)
66. Multi-threaded executor `ApplyDeferred` completed-tick lock-failure handoff path: normal, panic-payload, and handled-error ApplyDeferred barrier tasks now have explicit facades for the branch where the unapplied snapshot has been applied and completion queued, but `tick_executor` fails to acquire the executor lock, leaving the barrier running and dependent release pending until a later drain (89 executor isolated tests pass generated SA and default backend)
67. Multi-threaded executor non-send/local completed-tick handoff path: explicit `ecs_executor_run_plan_local_system_*_completed_tick_executor` facades now distinguish Bevy's `spawn_system_task` non-send branch from exclusive systems, preserving only the local-thread gate on lock failure and clearing it on completion without touching `exclusive_running` (92 executor isolated tests pass generated SA and default backend)
68. Multi-threaded executor multi-completion same-tick drain and lock-failure pending-retry path: `ecs_executor_tick_loop_retry_pending_completions` replays a lock-failed pending completion queue as the first later tick wave, and focused regressions prove multiple queued completions are drained before spawn so a join dependent can become ready and spawn in the same modeled tick (94 executor isolated tests pass generated SA and default backend)
69. Multi-threaded executor run-condition fold path: `ecs_executor_run_plan_evaluate_and_fold_conditions` and `ecs_executor_run_plan_should_run_with_condition_outcomes` model Bevy non-short-circuit condition evaluation, handled condition-error continuation, error-handler-panic abort, and set-failure followed by system-condition fold (98 executor isolated tests pass generated SA and default backend)

## Remaining (minor)
- Full SAB backend verification once compiler large-file limit is resolved
- Continue refining edge cases as bevy_ecs evolves
- Full runtime reflection remains intentionally out of scope until a downstream scene/editor/scripting subsystem needs reflected handles; API-surface descriptors are covered by `lib/reflect*.sla` and `lib/app_type_registry.sla`.

## Batch 122 — entity_hash_map_refs_default_backend_unblocker (2026-07-04)
- lib/entity_hash_map_extras.sla: reshaped the borrowed-value `Extend<(&Entity, &V)>` model so `ecs_ehm_extend_refs` accepts `Vec<i64>` values and casts to the stored `i32` value at insertion, avoiding the focused default/SAB raw `Vec<i32>` indexing failure from Batch 115.
- 0 new tests — revalidated existing test_ecs_lib_entity_hash_map_extras_isolated.sla
- Tests unchanged: 3361 isolated tests, lib modules unchanged: 244, test files unchanged: 170

## Batch 125 — remote_allocator_close_semantics (2026-07-04)
- lib/remote_allocator.sla: aligned the remote allocator model with Bevy's diagnostic-only closed state. `close` now only flips `is_closed`; `alloc` and `alloc_batch` continue to issue entities from the snapshot, matching the source `RemoteAllocator` behavior.
- tests/test_ecs_lib_node_spawner_allocator_isolated.sla: updated the remote allocator close case so it verifies allocation still works after closure instead of expecting allocation failure.
- 0 new tests — revalidated the same 28-test node/spawner/allocator suite on SA backend and default backend.
- Verification passed with `SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/remote_allocator.sla`, `SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla test tests/test_ecs_lib_node_spawner_allocator_isolated.sla --test-backend sa`, `SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla test tests/test_ecs_lib_node_spawner_allocator_isolated.sla`, and `git diff --check`.
- Feature progress: Bevy ECS entity/remote_allocator.rs close-state semantics now match diagnostic-only behavior; overall estimate remains API parity ~94–96%, behavioral parity ~82–87% because the major remaining gaps are still the dynamic multithread executor and full runtime reflection.
### Grand Total unchanged: 3392 isolated tests across 172 test files, 246 lib modules, all passing on SA backend; Batch 125 also passes default backend.

## Batch 126 — entity_allocator_alloc_many_iterator (2026-07-04)
- lib/entity_allocator_extras.sla: reshaped `alloc_many` to model the iterator-shaped Bevy surface more closely. The returned alloc-many result now carries the allocated entity sequence plus a cursor, with `count`/`first` helpers backed by the iterator state and new `next`/`size_hint` helpers for the remaining sequence.
- tests/test_ecs_lib_entity_allocator_extras_isolated.sla: updated the alloc-many cases to exercise iterator-style advancement and size-hint tracking while preserving the existing entity-allocation and restart coverage.
- 0 new tests — revalidated the same 18-test entity allocator suite on SA backend and default backend.
- Verification passed with `SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/entity_allocator_extras.sla`, `SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla test tests/test_ecs_lib_entity_allocator_extras_isolated.sla --test-backend sa`, `SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla test tests/test_ecs_lib_entity_allocator_extras_isolated.sla`, and `git diff --check`.
- Feature progress: Bevy ECS entity/mod.rs `EntityAllocator::alloc_many` now tracks iterator-style progress instead of only a summary pair; overall estimate remains API parity ~94–96%, behavioral parity ~82–87% because the major remaining gaps are still the dynamic multithread executor and full runtime reflection.
### Grand Total unchanged: 3392 isolated tests across 172 test files, 246 lib modules, all passing on SA backend; Batch 126 also passes default backend.

## Batch 127 — never_facade (2026-07-06)
- lib/never.sla: EcsNever uninhabited marker facade for src/never.rs parity. SLA has no language-level never type, so this is a no-constructor marker with stable metadata and panic-only absurd helpers.
- 2 isolated tests — test_ecs_lib_never_isolated.sla; focused run sees 4 tests including lib inline sanity tests.
- Tests: 3392 → 3394, lib modules: 246 → 247, test files: 172 → 173; source `.sla` @test total: 3,802.
- Verification: `SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/never.sla`; `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla test tests/test_ecs_lib_never_isolated.sla --test-backend sa`.
- src/never.rs ✓ (library-level marker facade)

## Batch 128 — app_type_registry_descriptors (2026-07-06)
- lib/app_type_registry.sla: EcsAppTypeRegistry + EcsAppFunctionRegistry descriptor registries for reflect::AppTypeRegistry/AppFunctionRegistry parity. Covers descriptor registration/replacement/query/order plus type-data slots for component/resource/event/message/bundle/from_world/map_entities. This is descriptor API-surface parity, not full bevy_reflect runtime reflection.
- 11 isolated tests — test_ecs_lib_app_type_registry_isolated.sla.
- Tests: 3394 → 3405, lib modules: 247 → 248, test files: 173 → 174; source `.sla` @test total: 3,813.
- Verification: `SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/app_type_registry.sla`; `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla test tests/test_ecs_lib_app_type_registry_isolated.sla --test-backend sa`; default `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla test tests/test_ecs_lib_app_type_registry_isolated.sla`.
- src/reflect/mod.rs AppTypeRegistry/AppFunctionRegistry ✓ (descriptor registry surface)

## Batch 129 — executor_multi_threaded_drive_plan (2026-07-06)
- lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla: EcsExecutorSystemSpec + EcsExecutorRunPlan drive-plan layer for the multi-threaded executor surface. Covers ready selection, drive_one/drive_all, dependency/dependent propagation, run-condition skip handling, deferred apply tracking, exclusive/local flag metadata, and run/apply/skip order accessors. Also fixes `ecs_executor_state_running_count` to count running systems.
- 4 isolated tests — test_ecs_lib_executor_multi_threaded_isolated.sla.
- Tests: 3405 → 3409, lib modules unchanged: 248, test files unchanged: 174; source `.sla` @test total: 3,817.
- Verification: `SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla`; `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla test tests/test_ecs_lib_executor_multi_threaded_isolated.sla --test-backend sa`; default `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla test tests/test_ecs_lib_executor_multi_threaded_isolated.sla`.
- src/schedule/executor/multi_threaded.rs ✓ (explicit plan-driving surface; full TaskPool/Scope dynamic executor remains out of scope)

## Batch 130 — result_recoverable_facades (2026-07-06)
- lib/ecs_world.sla: extended library-owned Result recoverable world facades with `ecs_world_try_despawn_result`, `ecs_world_try_get_mut`, `ecs_world_try_get_resource_ref`, `ecs_world_try_get_resource_mut`, and `ecs_world_try_modify_resource`; `ecs_world_try_query_single` now returns `ERR_QUERY_MULTIPLE_MATCH()` when more than one entity matches.
- tests/test_ecs_result_facades.sla: added 3 stable focused tests covering Result world despawn, mutable component accessor errors, and resource ref/mut/modify errors. A `Result<EntityItem<T>>` focused-filter cleanup trap was reported to the SLA compiler docs instead of worked around in compiler source.
- Tests: 3409 → 3412, lib modules unchanged: 248, test files unchanged: 174; source `.sla` @test total: 3,820.
- Verification: `SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/ecs_world.sla`; `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla test tests/test_ecs_result_facades.sla --test-backend sa` passes with 172 tests; default/SAB focused filters for the three stable new tests pass.
- Compiler issue doc: `/home/vscode/projects/sa_plugins/sa_plugin_sla/docs/result_entityitem_filter_cleanup_issue_cn.md` records the `Result<EntityItem<T>>` filter cleanup / SAB `VerificationTrap` issue.
- src/world/error.rs + recoverable World try_* facade surface ✓ (library-owned Result path, no compiler keywords)

## Batch 131 — entity_map_serialization_snapshot (2026-07-06)
- lib/entity_map_entities.sla: added structured serialization/entity-mapping helpers for Bevy scene/entity remap flows. `EcsEntityMapSnapshot` encodes `SceneEntityMapper` as `[next_remote, count, src, dst, ...]`, restores from snapshots with truncated-pair tolerance, and adds batch `get_or_allocate_many` plus `apply_many` helpers with missing-source reporting.
- tests/test_ecs_lib_entity_map_entities_isolated.sla: added 5 isolated tests for snapshot encoding, snapshot restoration, truncated snapshot recovery, duplicate-preserving batch allocation, and strict/identity map application.
- Tests: 3412 → 3417, lib modules unchanged: 248, test files unchanged: 174; source `.sla` @test total: 3,825.
- Verification: `SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/entity_map_entities.sla`; `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla test tests/test_ecs_lib_entity_map_entities_isolated.sla --test-backend sa`; default `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla test tests/test_ecs_lib_entity_map_entities_isolated.sla`.
- src/entity/map_entities.rs + scene serialization remap surface ✓ (library-level snapshot/remap, no compiler serde)

## Batch 132 — executor_ready_batch_model (2026-07-06)
- lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla: added ready-batch selection and completion for the multi-threaded executor plan layer. `EcsExecutorReadyBatch` and `EcsExecutorReadyBatchResult` model one batch of ready systems; ordinary non-exclusive/non-local systems can be selected up to a width limit, while exclusive/local systems serialize as singleton batches. Added `ecs_executor_run_plan_take_ready_batch`, `ecs_executor_run_plan_complete_ready_batch`, `ecs_executor_run_plan_drive_ready_batch`, and `ecs_executor_run_plan_drive_all_batched`.
- lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla: fixed false run-condition semantics so skipped systems release dependents instead of stalling downstream systems. New helper path: `ecs_executor_state_release_dependents`, `ecs_executor_state_skip_system_with_dependents`, and `ecs_executor_run_plan_skip_ready`.
- tests/test_ecs_lib_executor_multi_threaded_isolated.sla: added 4 focused isolated tests for ready-batch width selection, exclusive/local singleton serialization, skipped-system dependent release, and batched drive order/deferred apply tracking. Existing run-condition test was updated to expect downstream execution after a skip.
- lib/system_param_table_erased.sla: also retains the adjacent ordinary table-erased `Query<Entity> + Commands` runner slice (`TableErasedEntityQueryCommandsParam`, `table_erased_run_entity_query_commands_system`) with one inline regression for deferred Commands semantics.
- Tests: 3417 → 3421 isolated tests, lib modules unchanged: 248, test files unchanged: 174; source `.sla` @test total: 3,830.
- Verification: `SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla`; focused SA tests with `--jobs 1 --trace-panic` for `executor_ready_group_selects_two`, `executor_ready_group_serializes_one`, `executor_ready_group_releases_dependents`, `executor_ready_group_drive_width`, and `executor_run_plan_skips_run_condition_false`; default/SAB smoke for `executor_ready_group_selects_two` and `executor_ready_group_drive_width`. Also verified `SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/system_param_table_erased.sla`, focused SA/default for `table erased entity query commands param defers spawned entity`, and whole-file SA `lib/system_param_table_erased.sla` with 125 passed.
- Feature progress: Bevy ECS schedule/executor multi-threaded plan layer 85% -> 90%; overall estimate moves to API parity ~94–96%, behavioral parity ~83–88%. Remaining gap: connecting ready batches to a general thread-backed TaskPool/Scope-style dynamic runner with full access-conflict grouping.

## Batch 133 — executor_ready_batch_up_to3_thread_bridge (2026-07-06)
- lib/parallel_runner.sla: added `EcsParallelReadyBatchRunResult`, `ecs_parallel_run_ready_pair_batch`, `ecs_parallel_run_mut_triple_batch`, `ecs_parallel_run_ready_triple_batch`, `ecs_parallel_run_single_batch`, and `ecs_parallel_run_ready_batch_up_to3`, the first concrete bridges from `EcsExecutorRunPlan` ready-batch selection into pthread-backed runners. The up-to-3 dispatch entry takes one ready batch, serializes one-wide exclusive/local batches, routes two-wide batches to the pair runner, routes three-wide batches to the triple runner, and completes the executor plan so dependents become ready.
- tests/test_ecs_mut_parallel.sla: added 5 tests proving pair bridge advancement, pair mismatch rejection without starting threads, triple bridge completion releasing a dependent system, width dispatch selecting pair when max width is 3 but only two systems are ready, and width dispatch serializing one exclusive system while releasing its dependent.
- Tests: 3421 -> 3426 isolated tests, lib modules unchanged: 248, test files unchanged: 174; source `.sla` @test total: 3,835.
- Verification: `SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/parallel_runner.sla`; focused generated-SA tests for all five new ready-batch bridge/dispatch cases; whole-file generated-SA `tests/test_ecs_mut_parallel.sla` with 75 passed. Default/SAB focused smoke currently fails with `UnknownRegister: callee is not declared`; compiler issue recorded at `/home/vscode/projects/sa_plugins/sa_plugin_sla/docs/sab_thread_fnptr_ready_batch_unknown_register_issue_cn.md` without modifying compiler source.
- Feature progress: Bevy ECS schedule/executor multi-threaded threaded bridge 0% -> 55%; executor plan + ready-batch layer remains 90%. Overall estimate remains API parity ~94–96%, behavioral parity ~83–88% because arbitrary-N TaskPool/Scope-style dynamic scheduling and full runtime reflection remain outside the completed behavior set.

## Batch 134 — executor_ready_all_up_to3_loop (2026-07-06)
- lib/parallel_runner.sla: added `ecs_parallel_run_ready_catalog_batch_up_to3`, a catalog-aware batch bridge that maps the actual ready system indexes onto a fixed three-function catalog instead of assuming first/second/third positional order. Added `ecs_parallel_run_ready_all_up_to3`, which repeatedly takes ready batches, dispatches singleton/pair/triple work, accumulates thread sum/run/skip metadata, and exits on completion, mismatch, or stall.
- tests/test_ecs_mut_parallel.sla: added `all dispatch two waves`, `all dispatch skip releases dependent`, and `all dispatch mismatch status`. These cover a pair wave releasing a singleton dependent wave, a false run-condition skip releasing its dependent within the loop, and an unknown ready system returning mismatch/stalled without an infinite loop.
- Tests: 3426 -> 3429 isolated tests, lib modules unchanged: 248, test files unchanged: 174; source `.sla` @test total: 3,838.
- Verification: `SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/parallel_runner.sla`; whole-file generated-SA `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla test tests/test_ecs_mut_parallel.sla --test-backend sa --jobs 1 --trace-panic` passes with 78 tests. Focused default/SAB smoke passes for ready pair/triple/width and the three new all-dispatch cases. Whole-file default/SAB aggregation fails with `UseAfterMove tmp_67`; compiler issue recorded at `/home/vscode/projects/sa_plugins/sa_plugin_sla/docs/sab_aggregate_mut_parallel_use_after_move_issue_cn.md` without modifying compiler source.
- Feature progress: Bevy ECS schedule/executor multi-threaded threaded bridge 55% -> 70%; executor plan + ready-batch layer remains 90%+. Overall estimate moves to API parity ~94–96%, behavioral parity ~84–89% because arbitrary-N function catalogs, conflict-selected dynamic grouping, and full TaskPool/Scope semantics remain outside the completed behavior set.

## Batch 135 — executor_ready_nonconflicting_up_to3 (2026-07-06)
- lib/parallel_runner.sla: added access-conflict-aware ready-batch selection for the fixed three-function executor catalog. `ecs_parallel_take_ready_nonconflicting_catalog_batch_up_to3` greedily walks ready systems, skips false run-condition systems while releasing dependents, serializes exclusive/local systems as singleton batches, and admits only systems whose `TableErasedSystemAccess` is compatible with already selected systems.
- lib/parallel_runner.sla: added `ecs_parallel_run_ready_nonconflicting_catalog_batch_up_to3` and `ecs_parallel_run_ready_all_nonconflicting_up_to3`, so conflicting ready systems are left ready and drained in later waves instead of panicking or reporting a mismatch.
- tests/test_ecs_mut_parallel.sla: added `nonconflict batch skips conflicting ready` and `nonconflict conflict waves`, covering a ready set where systems 0 and 1 both write the same component while system 2 is compatible. The first batch runs 0+2 on threads; the loop then drains 1 as a later singleton.
- Tests: 3429 -> 3431 isolated tests, lib modules unchanged: 248, test files unchanged: 174; source `.sla` @test total: 3,840.
- Verification: `SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/parallel_runner.sla`; focused generated-SA tests for both new cases; whole-file generated-SA `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla test tests/test_ecs_mut_parallel.sla --test-backend sa --jobs 1 --trace-panic` passes with 80 tests. Focused default/SAB smoke passes for both new cases. Whole-file default/SAB aggregation still fails with the known `UseAfterMove tmp_67`; compiler issue doc updated at `/home/vscode/projects/sa_plugins/sa_plugin_sla/docs/sab_aggregate_mut_parallel_use_after_move_issue_cn.md` without modifying compiler source.
- Feature progress: Bevy ECS schedule/executor multi-threaded threaded bridge 70% -> 80%; executor plan + ready-batch layer remains 90%+. Overall estimate moves to API parity ~94–96%, behavioral parity ~85–90% because arbitrary-N catalogs and full TaskPool/Scope semantics remain outside the completed behavior set.

## Batch 136 — executor_ready_dynamic_catalog_up_to3 (2026-07-06)
- lib/parallel_runner.sla: added `EcsParallelFnCatalog<R, M>` with dynamic `Vec<i64>` system ids, `Vec<fn(Arc<*TableErasedWorld<R, M>>) -> i32>` runners, and `Vec<TableErasedSystemAccess>` access metadata. Added constructor/add/len/find-slot helpers.
- lib/parallel_runner.sla: added dynamic-catalog ready selection and dispatch: `ecs_parallel_take_ready_dynamic_catalog_batch_up_to3`, `ecs_parallel_run_selected_dynamic_catalog_batch_up_to3`, `ecs_parallel_run_ready_dynamic_catalog_batch_up_to3`, and `ecs_parallel_run_ready_all_dynamic_catalog_up_to3`. Catalog length can exceed three; current concrete execution width remains capped at three per batch.
- tests/test_ecs_mut_parallel.sla: added `dynamic catalog first wave` and `dynamic catalog waves`, covering a four-system catalog where systems 0 and 1 conflict, systems 2 and 3 are compatible, first wave runs 0+2+3, and the loop drains 1 in a later singleton wave.
- Tests: 3431 -> 3433 isolated tests, lib modules unchanged: 248, test files unchanged: 174; source `.sla` @test total: 3,842.
- Verification: `SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/parallel_runner.sla`; focused generated-SA tests for both new cases; whole-file generated-SA `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla test tests/test_ecs_mut_parallel.sla --test-backend sa --jobs 1 --trace-panic` passes with 82 tests. Focused default/SAB smoke passes for both dynamic catalog cases. Whole-file default/SAB aggregation still fails with the known `UseAfterMove tmp_67`; compiler issue doc updated at `/home/vscode/projects/sa_plugins/sa_plugin_sla/docs/sab_aggregate_mut_parallel_use_after_move_issue_cn.md` without modifying compiler source.
- Feature progress: Bevy ECS schedule/executor multi-threaded threaded bridge 80% -> 88%; executor plan + ready-batch layer remains 90%+. Overall estimate moves to API parity ~94–96%, behavioral parity ~86–91% because full TaskPool/Scope worker scheduling remains outside the completed behavior set.

## Batch 137 — task_pool_custom_batch_width (2026-07-07)
- lib/parallel_runner.sla: added `ecs_parallel_task_pool_with_batch_width`, separating Bevy-like TaskPool worker count from the per-wave ready/scoped batch width. The helper clamps negative worker/width inputs to zero and caps width at worker count, while preserving `ecs_parallel_task_pool_new(n)` as the worker-count-equals-width default.
- tests/test_ecs_mut_parallel.sla: added `task pool custom batch width separates worker count from waves`, proving lifecycle callbacks still run once per worker (`worker_count=4`) while scoped threaded tasks are batched by the narrower width (`max_batch_width=2`, five tasks -> three waves).
- Verification: `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/parallel_runner.sla`; focused generated-SA test for the new custom-width case; whole-file generated-SA `timeout 240s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla test tests/test_ecs_mut_parallel.sla --test-backend sa --jobs 1 --trace-panic` passes with 133 tests.
- Compiler/SAB note: focused default/SAB for the new custom-width test currently fails with `UnknownRegister: dst`; recorded at `/home/vscode/projects/sa_plugins/sa_plugin_sla/docs/sab_task_pool_custom_batch_width_unknown_dst_issue_cn.md`; no compiler source was modified in this ECS stream.
- Feature progress: Bevy ECS schedule/executor TaskPool/Scope facade now models separate worker-count and dispatch-width controls; overall estimate remains API parity ~94–96%, behavioral parity ~86–91% because full runtime reflection and exact Bevy TaskPool internals remain outside the completed behavior set.

## Batch 138 — main_thread_executor_facade (2026-07-07)
- lib/parallel_runner.sla: imported the existing `thread_executor.sla` model and added `EcsParallelMainThreadExecutor`, mirroring Bevy `MainThreadExecutor(pub Arc<ThreadExecutor<'static>>)` as a newtyped resource facade. Added default/new/new_with_id constructors, owner/executor id accessors, owner-thread ticker detection, same-id comparison, and `ecs_parallel_scope_options_with_main_thread_executor`.
- tests/test_ecs_mut_parallel.sla: added `main thread executor facade preserves owner ticker and identity` and `main thread executor options drive external executor identity`, proving owner-only ticker behavior, stable executor identity, and Scope option derivation for same-vs-different external executor ids.
- Verification: `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/parallel_runner.sla`; focused generated-SA tests for both MainThreadExecutor cases; whole-file generated-SA `timeout 240s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla test tests/test_ecs_mut_parallel.sla --test-backend sa --jobs 1 --trace-panic` passes with 139 tests.
- Default/SAB note: focused default/SAB passes for `main thread executor facade preserves owner ticker and identity`; focused default/SAB for `external executor identity` fails with `UnknownRegister: dst`, appended to `/home/vscode/projects/sa_plugins/sa_plugin_sla/docs/sab_task_pool_custom_batch_width_unknown_dst_issue_cn.md`; no compiler source was modified in this ECS stream.
- Feature progress: Bevy ECS schedule/executor MainThreadExecutor resource/scope-executor identity facade 0% -> 100%; overall estimate remains API parity ~94–96%, behavioral parity ~86–91% because full runtime reflection and exact Bevy TaskPool internals remain outside the completed behavior set.

## Batch 139 — executor_finish_run_cleanup (2026-07-07)
- lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla: added `ecs_executor_state_skipped_count`, `ecs_executor_state_evaluated_set_count`, `ecs_executor_state_finish_run`, and `ecs_multi_threaded_executor_finish_run`, mirroring the end of Bevy `MultiThreadedExecutor::run`.
- The finish helper clears transient ready/running/skipped/completed/evaluated state, resets running/local/exclusive flags, applies and clears `unapplied_systems` when `apply_final_deferred=true`, and preserves `unapplied_systems` when `apply_final_deferred=false`.
- tests/test_ecs_lib_executor_multi_threaded_isolated.sla: added final-deferred and no-final-deferred finish-run regressions.
- Verification: `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla`; focused generated-SA tests for both new cases; whole-file generated-SA and default backend `tests/test_ecs_lib_executor_multi_threaded_isolated.sla` both pass with 29 tests.
- Feature progress: Bevy ECS schedule/executor multi-threaded finish-run cleanup surface 0% -> 100%; overall estimate remains API parity ~94–96%, behavioral parity ~86–91% because full runtime reflection and exact Bevy TaskPool internals remain outside the completed behavior set.

## Batch 140 — executor_initial_debug_skip (2026-07-07)
- lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla: added `ecs_executor_run_plan_apply_initial_skips`, mirroring Bevy `MultiThreadedExecutor::run` startup behavior for `_skip_systems` under debug stepping. The helper marks initial skips as skipped/completed, clears their ready bit, and releases dependents before the ordinary run-plan drive loop.
- The helper avoids double-counting duplicate/already-completed skip inputs in this facade so shared dependents are not released twice.
- tests/test_ecs_lib_executor_multi_threaded_isolated.sla: added regressions for skipped root releasing a dependent, skipped ready systems not running, and multiple skipped roots releasing a shared dependent.
- Verification: `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla`; focused generated-SA initial-skip tests; whole-file generated-SA and default backend `tests/test_ecs_lib_executor_multi_threaded_isolated.sla` both pass with 32 tests.
- Feature progress: Bevy ECS schedule/executor initial debug-stepping skip surface 0% -> 100%; overall estimate remains API parity ~94–96%, behavioral parity ~86–91% because full runtime reflection and exact Bevy TaskPool internals remain outside the completed behavior set.

## Batch 141 — executor_active_running_can_run_gates (2026-07-07)
- lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla: added `ecs_executor_state_can_spawn_system`, `ecs_executor_run_plan_next_runnable`, and `ecs_executor_state_complete_system_with_flags`, bringing the run-plan selector closer to Bevy `ExecutorState::can_run` for active exclusive/local state.
- Ready-batch selection now waits while an exclusive system is active, defers exclusive candidates while other systems are running, and defers local/non-send candidates while another local system is running. Run-plan completion clears exclusive/local flags for completed systems, matching Bevy `finish_system_and_handle_dependents`.
- tests/test_ecs_lib_executor_multi_threaded_isolated.sla: added active-running can-spawn regressions and ready-batch gate regressions; updated the exclusive/local completion assertion to expect cleared flags.
- Verification: `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla`; whole-file generated-SA and default backend executor isolated tests both pass with 35 tests; `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/parallel_runner.sla`; focused generated-SA ready/nonconflict bridge tests and MainThreadExecutor tests pass.
- Note: whole-file generated-SA `tests/test_ecs_mut_parallel.sla` currently reports `Type Check Error: checkStmt failed at node tag for_stmt (error.TypeMismatch)` before execution; focused affected bridge tests pass and the broad compiler issue is documented at `/home/vscode/projects/sa_plugins/sa_plugin_sla/docs/sa_backend_mut_parallel_whole_file_for_stmt_typemismatch_issue_cn.md`.
- Feature progress: Bevy ECS schedule/executor active-running can-run gate surface 0% -> 100%; overall estimate remains API parity ~94–96%, behavioral parity ~86–91% because full runtime reflection and exact Bevy TaskPool internals remain outside the completed behavior set.

## Batch 142 — executor_failed_set_condition_pending_skip (2026-07-07)
- lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla: added `ecs_executor_state_mark_skipped_pending`, `ecs_executor_state_mark_set_evaluated`, `ecs_executor_state_is_set_evaluated`, and `ecs_executor_run_plan_apply_failed_set_condition`, modeling Bevy `ExecutorState::should_run` when a system set condition fails.
- Failed set conditions now mark all systems in the set as skipped and mark the set evaluated without completing those systems or releasing dependents immediately. When a pending-skipped system becomes ready, ready-batch and single-step driving route it through the normal skip/release path.
- tests/test_ecs_lib_executor_multi_threaded_isolated.sla: added pending-skip regressions for no-immediate-completion, ready skipped system releasing a dependent, and skipped child waiting for its upstream dependency before releasing its own dependent.
- Verification: `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla`; focused generated-SA failed-set-condition test; whole-file generated-SA and default backend executor isolated tests both pass with 38 tests; `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/parallel_runner.sla`; focused generated-SA ready/nonconflict bridge tests pass.
- Note: whole-file generated-SA `tests/test_ecs_mut_parallel.sla` remains a documented compiler/typecheck aggregation issue at `/home/vscode/projects/sa_plugins/sa_plugin_sla/docs/sa_backend_mut_parallel_whole_file_for_stmt_typemismatch_issue_cn.md`; focused affected bridge tests pass.
- Feature progress: Bevy ECS schedule/executor failed set-condition pending skip surface 0% -> 100%; overall estimate remains API parity ~94–96%, behavioral parity ~86–91% because full runtime reflection and exact Bevy TaskPool internals remain outside the completed behavior set.

## Batch 143 — executor_passed_set_condition_evaluated (2026-07-09)
- lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla: added `ecs_executor_run_plan_apply_passed_set_condition`, modeling the successful system-set condition branch in Bevy `ExecutorState::should_run`.
- Passed set conditions now mark the set evaluated without marking systems skipped, completed, or dependency-released. Applying a failed set condition for the same already-evaluated set is a no-op, matching Bevy's `if evaluated_sets.contains(set_idx) { continue; }` behavior.
- tests/test_ecs_lib_executor_multi_threaded_isolated.sla: added `executor_run_plan_passed_set_condition_marks_evaluated_only` and `executor_run_plan_passed_set_condition_blocks_later_failed_marking`.
- Verification: `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla`; focused generated-SA passed-set-condition tests; whole-file generated-SA and default backend executor isolated tests both pass with 40 tests; `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/parallel_runner.sla`; focused generated-SA ready/nonconflict bridge tests pass.
- Note: whole-file generated-SA `tests/test_ecs_mut_parallel.sla` remains a documented compiler/typecheck aggregation issue at `/home/vscode/projects/sa_plugins/sa_plugin_sla/docs/sa_backend_mut_parallel_whole_file_for_stmt_typemismatch_issue_cn.md`; focused affected bridge tests pass.
- Feature progress: Bevy ECS schedule/executor passed set-condition evaluated surface 0% -> 100%; overall estimate remains API parity ~94–96%, behavioral parity ~86–91% because full runtime reflection and exact Bevy TaskPool internals remain outside the completed behavior set.

## Batch 144 — executor_failed_system_condition_pending_skip (2026-07-09)
- lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla: added `ecs_executor_run_plan_apply_failed_system_condition`, modeling the per-system condition false branch in Bevy `ExecutorState::should_run`.
- Failed system conditions now mark only the current system as skipped, leave evaluated sets untouched, and do not complete or release dependents until the skipped system becomes ready and is processed by the normal skip path. Later set-condition evaluation remains possible.
- tests/test_ecs_lib_executor_multi_threaded_isolated.sla: added pending-skip regressions for current-system-only marking, skipped child dependency timing, and set-condition evaluation after a failed system condition.
- Verification: `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla`; focused generated-SA failed-system-condition tests; whole-file generated-SA and default backend executor isolated tests both pass with 43 tests; `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/parallel_runner.sla`; focused generated-SA ready/nonconflict bridge tests pass.
- Note: whole-file generated-SA `tests/test_ecs_mut_parallel.sla` remains a documented compiler/typecheck aggregation issue at `/home/vscode/projects/sa_plugins/sa_plugin_sla/docs/sa_backend_mut_parallel_whole_file_for_stmt_typemismatch_issue_cn.md`; focused affected bridge tests pass.
- Feature progress: Bevy ECS schedule/executor failed system-condition pending skip surface 0% -> 100%; overall estimate remains API parity ~94–96%, behavioral parity ~86–91% because full runtime reflection and exact Bevy TaskPool internals remain outside the completed behavior set.

## Batch 145 — executor_running_conflict_can_run_gates (2026-07-09)
- lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla: extended `EcsExecutorSystemSpec` with set-condition, system-condition, and ordinary access conflict metadata, plus helper constructors for those conflict sets.
- `ecs_executor_state_can_spawn_system` now models the remaining Bevy `ExecutorState::can_run` running-conflict gates: unevaluated set-condition conflicts block, system-condition conflicts block, ordinary access conflicts block only for non-skipped systems, and pending-skipped systems can still pass the gate to notify dependents.
- tests/test_ecs_lib_executor_multi_threaded_isolated.sla: added conflict regressions for direct can-spawn decisions, ready-batch deferral to a later ready candidate, and skipped systems releasing dependents despite ordinary access conflicts.
- Verification: `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla`; focused generated-SA conflict tests; whole-file generated-SA and default backend executor isolated tests both pass with 46 tests; `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/parallel_runner.sla`; focused generated-SA ready-triple and nonconflict bridge tests pass.
- Note: whole-file generated-SA `tests/test_ecs_mut_parallel.sla` remains a documented compiler/typecheck aggregation issue at `/home/vscode/projects/sa_plugins/sa_plugin_sla/docs/sa_backend_mut_parallel_whole_file_for_stmt_typemismatch_issue_cn.md`; focused affected bridge tests pass.
- Feature progress: Bevy ECS schedule/executor running-conflict can-run gate surface 0% -> 100%; overall estimate remains API parity ~94–96%, behavioral parity ~86–91% because full runtime reflection and exact Bevy TaskPool internals remain outside the completed behavior set.

## Batch 146 — executor_apply_deferred_barrier (2026-07-09)
- lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla: added `ecs_executor_system_spec_as_apply_deferred` and an apply-deferred barrier path for run-plan completion, modeling Bevy `spawn_exclusive_system_task` when the exclusive system is `ApplyDeferred`.
- The barrier now snapshots and clears currently unapplied systems before it completes, records the applied system indices, then marks the barrier itself completed/unapplied through the normal completion path. The helper also forces exclusive/local scheduling so ready-batch selection serializes it.
- tests/test_ecs_lib_executor_multi_threaded_isolated.sla: added regressions for applying only prior unapplied systems and for the exclusive/local ready-batch shape of an apply-deferred barrier.
- Verification: `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla`; focused generated-SA apply-deferred-barrier tests; whole-file generated-SA and default backend executor isolated tests both pass with 48 tests; `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/parallel_runner.sla`; focused generated-SA triple-bridge and nonconflict bridge tests pass.
- Note: whole-file generated-SA `tests/test_ecs_mut_parallel.sla` remains a documented compiler/typecheck aggregation issue at `/home/vscode/projects/sa_plugins/sa_plugin_sla/docs/sa_backend_mut_parallel_whole_file_for_stmt_typemismatch_issue_cn.md`; focused affected bridge tests pass.
- Feature progress: Bevy ECS schedule/executor exclusive ApplyDeferred barrier surface 0% -> 100%; overall estimate remains API parity ~94–96%, behavioral parity ~86–91% because full runtime reflection and exact Bevy TaskPool internals remain outside the completed behavior set.

## Batch 147 — executor_ready_rescan_after_skip (2026-07-09)
- lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla: updated `ecs_executor_run_plan_take_ready_batch` to remove systems from `ready_systems` as soon as they are selected for a batch and to rescan ready systems after skipped systems notify dependents.
- This models Bevy `spawn_system_tasks`: skipped systems may make dependents ready immediately, and selected systems are removed from `ready_systems` before spawning so a rescan cannot select them twice.
- tests/test_ecs_lib_executor_multi_threaded_isolated.sla: added `executor_ready_group_rescans_after_skip_for_lower_index_dependent` and updated the skipped/conflicting dependent assertion to expect selected ready systems to be removed from ready.
- Verification: `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla`; focused generated-SA rescan test; whole-file generated-SA and default backend executor isolated tests both pass with 49 tests; `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/parallel_runner.sla`; focused generated-SA nonconflict bridge tests pass.
- Note: whole-file generated-SA `tests/test_ecs_mut_parallel.sla` remains a documented compiler/typecheck aggregation issue at `/home/vscode/projects/sa_plugins/sa_plugin_sla/docs/sa_backend_mut_parallel_whole_file_for_stmt_typemismatch_issue_cn.md`; focused affected bridge tests pass.
- Feature progress: Bevy ECS schedule/executor ready rescan after skip surface 0% -> 100%; overall estimate remains API parity ~94–96%, behavioral parity ~86–91% because full runtime reflection and exact Bevy TaskPool internals remain outside the completed behavior set.

## Batch 148 — executor_selected_running_spawn_loop (2026-07-09)
- lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla: added `ecs_executor_run_plan_start_selected` and moved ready-batch spawn accounting into `ecs_executor_run_plan_take_ready_batch`, so selected systems immediately enter `running_systems`, increment `num_running_systems`, update local/exclusive flags, and append to run order.
- Ready-batch selection now matches the important Bevy `spawn_system_tasks` ordering point where `running_systems.insert(system_index)` happens before the loop considers later ready systems. Later candidates in the same spawn loop are blocked by access conflicts with newly selected systems, and dependents released by skipped systems cannot be selected in the same batch when they conflict with already selected/running systems.
- Non-exclusive local/non-send systems are no longer over-serialized: one local system can share a ready batch with send systems, while a second local candidate is still blocked by `local_thread_running`, matching Bevy's `spawn_system_task` behavior.
- tests/test_ecs_lib_executor_multi_threaded_isolated.sla: added `executor_ready_group_selected_system_blocks_later_conflict`, `executor_ready_group_allows_one_local_with_send_systems`, and `executor_ready_group_rescan_respects_selected_running_conflict`; updated `executor_ready_group_serializes_one` to expect the Bevy-style local+send batch after an exclusive system completes.
- Verification: `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla`; focused generated-SA tests for the three new cases; whole-file generated-SA and default backend executor isolated tests both pass with 52 tests; `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/parallel_runner.sla`; focused generated-SA ready/nonconflict bridge tests pass.
- Note: whole-file generated-SA `tests/test_ecs_mut_parallel.sla` remains a documented compiler/typecheck aggregation issue at `/home/vscode/projects/sa_plugins/sa_plugin_sla/docs/sa_backend_mut_parallel_whole_file_for_stmt_typemismatch_issue_cn.md`; focused affected bridge tests pass.
- Feature progress: Bevy ECS schedule/executor selected-running spawn-loop surface 0% -> 100%; overall estimate remains API parity ~94–96%, behavioral parity ~86–91% because full runtime reflection and exact Bevy TaskPool internals remain outside the completed behavior set.

## Batch 149 — executor_completed_dependent_signal_guard (2026-07-09)
- lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla: updated `ecs_executor_state_release_dependents` to only set a dependent ready when its dependency count reaches zero and that dependent is not already completed.
- This matches Bevy `ExecutorState::signal_dependents`, which checks `*remaining == 0 && !completed_systems.contains(dep_idx)` before inserting into `ready_systems`. The guard prevents debug/initial skip edge cases and repeated facade signal paths from re-readying systems that have already completed or been skipped.
- tests/test_ecs_lib_executor_multi_threaded_isolated.sla: added `executor_state_release_dependents_does_not_ready_completed_dependent` for direct state coverage and `executor_run_plan_initial_skip_completed_dependent_not_readied` for the run-plan initial-skip path.
- Verification: `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla`; focused generated-SA tests for the two new cases; whole-file generated-SA and default backend executor isolated tests both pass with 54 tests; `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/parallel_runner.sla`; focused generated-SA ready/nonconflict bridge tests pass.
- Note: whole-file generated-SA `tests/test_ecs_mut_parallel.sla` remains a documented compiler/typecheck aggregation issue at `/home/vscode/projects/sa_plugins/sa_plugin_sla/docs/sa_backend_mut_parallel_whole_file_for_stmt_typemismatch_issue_cn.md`; focused affected bridge tests pass.
- Feature progress: Bevy ECS schedule/executor completed-dependent signal guard surface 0% -> 100%; overall estimate remains API parity ~94–96%, behavioral parity ~86–91% because full runtime reflection and exact Bevy TaskPool internals remain outside the completed behavior set.

## Batch 150 — executor_begin_run_reset (2026-07-09)
- lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla: `EcsExecutorRunPlan` now stores each system's original dependency count, and `ecs_executor_run_plan_begin_run` resets a plan for a fresh schedule run.
- The begin-run helper mirrors the startup block in Bevy `MultiThreadedExecutor::run`: dependency counts are restored from the schedule snapshot, `ready_systems` is reset from `starting_systems`, running/skipped/completed/evaluated transient state and per-run counters/orders are cleared, and `local_thread_running` / `exclusive_running` are reset.
- Existing `unapplied_systems` are intentionally preserved, matching Bevy's behavior when final deferred application is disabled and unapplied buffers remain across a run boundary.
- tests/test_ecs_lib_executor_multi_threaded_isolated.sla: added `executor_run_plan_begin_run_resets_dependencies_and_ready` and `executor_run_plan_begin_run_preserves_unapplied_buffers`.
- Verification: `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla`; focused generated-SA tests for the two new cases; whole-file generated-SA and default backend executor isolated tests both pass with 56 tests; `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/parallel_runner.sla`; focused generated-SA ready/nonconflict bridge tests pass.
- Note: whole-file generated-SA `tests/test_ecs_mut_parallel.sla` remains a documented compiler/typecheck aggregation issue at `/home/vscode/projects/sa_plugins/sa_plugin_sla/docs/sa_backend_mut_parallel_whole_file_for_stmt_typemismatch_issue_cn.md`; focused affected bridge tests pass.
- Feature progress: Bevy ECS schedule/executor begin-run reset surface 0% -> 100%; overall estimate remains API parity ~94–96%, behavioral parity ~86–91% because full runtime reflection and exact Bevy TaskPool internals remain outside the completed behavior set.

## Batch 151 — executor_deferred_apply_timing (2026-07-09)
- lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla: ordinary systems with deferred buffers now remain in `unapplied_systems` after completion instead of being applied immediately.
- This matches Bevy `finish_system_and_handle_dependents` / `apply_deferred` timing: completion records the system as unapplied, explicit `ApplyDeferred` barriers flush the current unapplied snapshot before completing, and final cleanup flushes pending buffers when `apply_final_deferred=true`.
- This batch still used a pending-buffer simplification for non-deferred systems; Batch 152 supersedes it with Bevy-exact all-completed-system tracking.
- tests/test_ecs_lib_executor_multi_threaded_isolated.sla: added `executor_run_plan_apply_deferred_barrier_applies_completed_deferred_system` and updated dependency-order / batched-width regressions to expect pending deferred buffers until final cleanup.
- tests/test_ecs_mut_parallel.sla: updated `task pool defers buffers until final apply` so the threaded ready runner leaves deferred buffers pending until `ecs_multi_threaded_executor_finish_run`.
- Verification: `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla`; focused generated-SA barrier and task-pool deferred tests; whole-file generated-SA and default backend executor isolated tests both pass with 57 tests; `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/parallel_runner.sla`; focused generated-SA ready/nonconflict bridge tests pass; focused default backend task-pool deferred test passes; `git diff --check` passes.
- Note: whole-file generated-SA `tests/test_ecs_mut_parallel.sla` remains a documented compiler/typecheck aggregation issue at `/home/vscode/projects/sa_plugins/sa_plugin_sla/docs/sa_backend_mut_parallel_whole_file_for_stmt_typemismatch_issue_cn.md`; focused affected bridge tests pass.
- Feature progress: Bevy ECS schedule/executor deferred-system apply timing surface 0% -> 100%; overall estimate remains API parity ~94–96%, behavioral parity ~86–91% because full runtime reflection and exact Bevy TaskPool internals remain outside the completed behavior set.

## Batch 152 — executor_all_completed_unapplied_tracking (2026-07-09)
- lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla: `ecs_executor_run_plan_apply_deferred_for` no longer clears ordinary non-deferred systems after completion.
- This matches Bevy's exact `unapplied_systems` semantics: `finish_system_and_handle_dependents` inserts every completed system, and explicit `ApplyDeferred` barriers / final cleanup iterate the whole set. Systems without actual deferred buffers are represented as no-op `apply_deferred` calls.
- tests/test_ecs_lib_executor_multi_threaded_isolated.sla: added `executor_run_plan_records_non_deferred_unapplied_until_apply` and `executor_run_plan_apply_deferred_barrier_applies_completed_non_deferred_system`, and updated dependency-order / batched-width regressions to count all completed systems during final cleanup.
- tests/test_ecs_mut_parallel.sla: updated `task pool defers buffers until final apply` so both threaded completed systems remain pending until `ecs_multi_threaded_executor_finish_run`.
- Verification: `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla`; focused generated-SA non-deferred and task-pool tests; whole-file generated-SA and default backend executor isolated tests both pass with 58 tests; `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/parallel_runner.sla`; focused generated-SA ready/nonconflict bridge tests pass; focused default backend task-pool deferred test passes; `git diff --check` passes.
- Note: whole-file generated-SA `tests/test_ecs_mut_parallel.sla` remains a documented compiler/typecheck aggregation issue at `/home/vscode/projects/sa_plugins/sa_plugin_sla/docs/sa_backend_mut_parallel_whole_file_for_stmt_typemismatch_issue_cn.md`; focused affected bridge tests pass.
- Feature progress: Bevy ECS schedule/executor all-completed unapplied tracking surface 0% -> 100%; overall estimate remains API parity ~94–96%, behavioral parity ~86–91% because full runtime reflection and exact Bevy TaskPool internals remain outside the completed behavior set.

## Batch 159 — executor_tick_executor_try_lock_failure (2026-07-09)
- lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla: `EcsExecutorTickLoopResult` now carries `pending_completions` and `lock_failed` metadata, plus accessors for the modeled pending queue. Added `ecs_executor_run_plan_system_completed_tick_executor_lock_failed`, `ecs_executor_run_plan_system_panic_payload_completed_tick_executor_lock_failed`, and `ecs_executor_run_plan_system_handled_error_completed_tick_executor_lock_failed`.
- This models the Bevy `Context::tick_executor` branch where `try_lock().ok()?` fails: `system_completed` has already pushed the completion result and recorded any panic payload / handled error state, but the current thread returns without draining the queue, releasing dependents, or spawning newly ready systems. The pending completion remains observable for a later tick/drain path.
- tests/test_ecs_lib_executor_multi_threaded_isolated.sla: added lock-failure regressions for ordinary, panic-payload, and handled-error completions. The ordinary case also retries the pending completion through the existing completion-wave tick loop to prove the dependent only spawns once a later drain occurs.
- Verification: `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla`; focused generated-SA `lock_failed` tests pass; whole-file generated-SA and default backend executor isolated tests both pass with 76 tests; `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/parallel_runner.sla`; focused generated-SA ready/nonconflict bridge tests pass; focused default backend task-pool deferred test passes; `git diff --check` passes.
- Current measured counts: 270 lib modules, 174 test files, 90 examples, and 4,144 source `.sla` `@test` annotations.
- Feature progress: Bevy ECS schedule/executor `tick_executor` try-lock failure surface 0% -> 100%; overall estimate remains API parity ~94–96%, behavioral parity ~86–91% because full runtime reflection and exact Bevy TaskPool internals remain outside the completed behavior set.

## Batch 160 — executor_system_completed_finish_run_closure (2026-07-09)
- tests/test_ecs_lib_executor_multi_threaded_isolated.sla: added focused coverage for `Context::system_completed` handoff through the run-end cleanup/rethrow boundary. `executor_run_plan_apply_deferred_completed_tick_executor_applies_prior_and_spawns` proves an `ApplyDeferred` barrier completed via tick handoff flushes prior unapplied systems before it completes, then spawns a dependent in the same handoff. `executor_run_plan_system_panic_completed_tick_executor_finish_run_rethrows_after_final_apply` proves a panic-payload completion handoff still completes the dependent, final-applies both completed systems, and only then reaches the modeled `take_panic_payload` rethrow point. `executor_run_plan_system_handled_error_completed_tick_executor_finish_run_has_no_rethrow` proves the handled-error branch follows the same final deferred cleanup path without setting a payload or incrementing rethrow count.
- This locks down the Bevy sequence from `Context::system_completed` / `tick_executor` back into `MultiThreadedExecutor::run`: queued completions are drained into `finish_system_and_handle_dependents`, `ApplyDeferred` barriers flush the unapplied snapshot before dependent spawn, final deferred cleanup runs after all systems complete, and panic propagation is observed at the final payload take boundary.
- Verification: `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla`; focused generated-SA `completed_tick_executor` tests pass; whole-file generated-SA and default backend executor isolated tests both pass with 79 tests; `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/parallel_runner.sla`; focused generated-SA ready/nonconflict bridge tests pass; focused default backend task-pool deferred test passes; `git diff --check` passes.
- Current measured counts: 270 lib modules, 174 test files, 90 examples, and 4,147 source `.sla` `@test` annotations.
- Feature progress: Bevy ECS schedule/executor `Context::system_completed` finish-run closure surface 0% -> 100%; overall estimate remains API parity ~94–96%, behavioral parity ~86–91% because full runtime reflection and exact Bevy TaskPool internals remain outside the completed behavior set.

## Batch 161 — executor_apply_deferred_completed_tick_error_handoff (2026-07-09)
- lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla: added `ecs_executor_run_plan_apply_deferred_panic_payload_completed_tick_executor` and `ecs_executor_run_plan_apply_deferred_handled_error_completed_tick_executor`. These combine the existing ApplyDeferred snapshot application helpers with the `Context::system_completed` tick handoff path.
- This models the Bevy `spawn_exclusive_system_task` branch for `ApplyDeferred`: the barrier task clones and clears the current `unapplied_systems`, calls `apply_deferred`, records a deferred apply panic payload or handled error if needed, then calls `system_completed`, whose immediate `tick_executor` drain completes the barrier, marks it unapplied, and releases dependents.
- tests/test_ecs_lib_executor_multi_threaded_isolated.sla: added `executor_run_plan_apply_deferred_panic_completed_tick_executor_records_deferred_payload_and_spawns` and `executor_run_plan_apply_deferred_handled_error_completed_tick_executor_records_error_and_spawns`. The regressions prove prior unapplied systems are cleared, apply order/counters match the cloned snapshot semantics, deferred panic/handled-error phase markers are recorded instead of system-phase markers, and dependents spawn in the same tick handoff.
- Verification: `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla`; focused generated-SA `apply_deferred_` tests pass; whole-file generated-SA and default backend executor isolated tests both pass with 81 tests; `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/parallel_runner.sla`; focused generated-SA ready/nonconflict bridge tests pass; focused default backend task-pool deferred test passes; `git diff --check` passes.
- Current measured counts: 270 lib modules, 174 test files, 90 examples, and 4,149 source `.sla` `@test` annotations.
- Feature progress: Bevy ECS schedule/executor `ApplyDeferred` completed-tick deferred error handoff surface 0% -> 100%; overall estimate remains API parity ~94–96%, behavioral parity ~86–91% because full runtime reflection and exact Bevy TaskPool internals remain outside the completed behavior set.

## Batch 162 — executor_exclusive_completed_tick_handoff (2026-07-09)
- lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla: exclusive systems are now treated as implicitly local/non-send in `ecs_executor_system_spec_new`, `ecs_executor_state_start_system`, and `ecs_executor_state_complete_system_with_flags`, matching Bevy `ExclusiveFunctionSystem::flags()` and `spawn_exclusive_system_task` setting both `exclusive_running` and `local_thread_running`. Added explicit `ecs_executor_run_plan_exclusive_system_completed_tick_executor`, `ecs_executor_run_plan_exclusive_system_panic_payload_completed_tick_executor`, `ecs_executor_run_plan_exclusive_system_handled_error_completed_tick_executor`, and matching try-lock-failure facades.
- This models the non-`ApplyDeferred` branch of Bevy `spawn_exclusive_system_task`: an exclusive task runs with full world access, calls `system_completed`, records any system panic payload or handled error in the same phase as ordinary systems, and completes through `tick_executor` without applying unrelated prior `unapplied_systems` until a later `ApplyDeferred` barrier or final cleanup.
- tests/test_ecs_lib_executor_multi_threaded_isolated.sla: added `executor_run_plan_exclusive_completed_tick_executor_spawns_without_apply_barrier`, `executor_run_plan_exclusive_panic_completed_tick_executor_lock_failed_keeps_flags`, and `executor_run_plan_exclusive_handled_error_completed_tick_executor_spawns_dependent`. The regressions cover no accidental apply-deferred barrier behavior, exclusive/local flag retention when `try_lock` fails, later completion retry, system-phase payload/handled-error bookkeeping, and dependent spawn after the exclusive completion is drained.
- Verification: `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla`; focused generated-SA `exclusive_` tests pass; whole-file generated-SA and default backend executor isolated tests both pass with 84 tests; `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/parallel_runner.sla`; focused generated-SA ready/nonconflict/dispatch bridge tests pass; focused default backend task-pool deferred test passes; `git diff --check` passes.
- Current measured counts: 270 lib modules, 174 test files, 90 examples, and 4,152 source `.sla` `@test` annotations.
- Feature progress: Bevy ECS schedule/executor non-`ApplyDeferred` exclusive completed-tick handoff surface 0% -> 100%; overall estimate remains API parity ~94–96%, behavioral parity ~86–91% because full runtime reflection and exact Bevy TaskPool internals remain outside the completed behavior set.

## Batch 163 — executor_finish_run_without_final_deferred_error_handoff (2026-07-09)
- tests/test_ecs_lib_executor_multi_threaded_isolated.sla: added `executor_run_plan_system_panic_finish_run_without_final_deferred_preserves_payload_and_unapplied` and `executor_run_plan_system_handled_error_finish_run_without_final_deferred_preserves_unapplied_no_rethrow`.
- This models the Bevy `MultiThreadedExecutor::run` tail when `apply_final_deferred=false`: the final `apply_deferred` block is skipped, so completed systems stay in `unapplied_systems`; no deferred apply panic payload or handled error is recorded; transient ready/running/completed state is still cleared; an existing system panic payload remains pending until the modeled final `take_panic_payload` rethrow point; and handled system errors still do not create a rethrow.
- Verification: `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla`; focused generated-SA `without_final_deferred` tests pass; whole-file generated-SA and default backend executor isolated tests both pass with 86 tests; `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/parallel_runner.sla`; focused generated-SA ready/nonconflict/width-dispatch bridge tests pass; focused default backend task-pool deferred test passes; `git diff --check` passes.
- Current measured counts: 270 lib modules, 174 test files, 90 examples, and 4,154 source `.sla` `@test` annotations.
- Feature progress: Bevy ECS schedule/executor run-end disabled-final-deferred panic/handled-error surface 0% -> 100%; overall estimate remains API parity ~94–96%, behavioral parity ~86–91% because full runtime reflection and exact Bevy TaskPool internals remain outside the completed behavior set.

## Batch 164 — executor_apply_deferred_completed_tick_lock_failure (2026-07-09)
- lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla: added `ecs_executor_run_plan_apply_deferred_completed_tick_executor_lock_failed`, `ecs_executor_run_plan_apply_deferred_panic_payload_completed_tick_executor_lock_failed`, and `ecs_executor_run_plan_apply_deferred_handled_error_completed_tick_executor_lock_failed`.
- This models the Bevy `spawn_exclusive_system_task` / `ApplyDeferred` branch where the barrier task clones/clears and applies the current `unapplied_systems` snapshot, records a deferred apply panic payload or handled error if needed, pushes the barrier completion, then `Context::tick_executor` returns early because `try_lock().ok()?` failed. The completion remains pending; the barrier stays running and exclusive/local; prior unapplied systems have already been cleared by the cloned-snapshot apply path; and dependents only release when a later tick drains the pending completion.
- tests/test_ecs_lib_executor_multi_threaded_isolated.sla: added `executor_run_plan_apply_deferred_completed_tick_executor_lock_failed_keeps_barrier_pending`, `executor_run_plan_apply_deferred_panic_completed_tick_executor_lock_failed_records_payload_only`, and `executor_run_plan_apply_deferred_handled_error_completed_tick_executor_lock_failed_records_error_only`. The regressions cover normal, panic-payload, and handled-error lock-failure handoffs, plus retrying the pending barrier completion through the completion-wave loop.
- Verification: `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla`; focused generated-SA `lock_failed` tests pass; whole-file generated-SA and default backend executor isolated tests both pass with 89 tests; `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/parallel_runner.sla`; focused generated-SA ready/nonconflict/width-dispatch bridge tests pass; focused default backend task-pool deferred test passes; `git diff --check` passes.
- Current measured counts: 270 lib modules, 174 test files, 90 examples, and 4,157 source `.sla` `@test` annotations.
- Feature progress: Bevy ECS schedule/executor `ApplyDeferred` completed-tick lock-failure handoff surface 0% -> 100%; overall estimate remains API parity ~94–96%, behavioral parity ~86–91% because full runtime reflection and exact Bevy TaskPool internals remain outside the completed behavior set.

## Batch 165 — executor_local_completed_tick_handoff (2026-07-09)
- lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla: added explicit non-send/local completed-tick facades: `ecs_executor_run_plan_local_system_completed_tick_executor`, `ecs_executor_run_plan_local_system_completed_tick_executor_lock_failed`, `ecs_executor_run_plan_local_system_panic_payload_completed_tick_executor`, `ecs_executor_run_plan_local_system_panic_payload_completed_tick_executor_lock_failed`, `ecs_executor_run_plan_local_system_handled_error_completed_tick_executor`, and `ecs_executor_run_plan_local_system_handled_error_completed_tick_executor_lock_failed`.
- This models the Bevy `spawn_system_task` non-send branch separately from exclusive systems: a local system uses the same completion queue and `Context::tick_executor` handoff as send systems, sets `local_thread_running` while it runs, never sets `exclusive_running`, and on try-lock failure leaves completion pending without releasing dependents until a later drain.
- tests/test_ecs_lib_executor_multi_threaded_isolated.sla: added `executor_run_plan_local_completed_tick_executor_clears_local_without_exclusive`, `executor_run_plan_local_panic_completed_tick_executor_lock_failed_keeps_local_only`, and `executor_run_plan_local_handled_error_completed_tick_executor_spawns_dependent`. The regressions prove normal local completion can spawn a send dependent while another send system remains running, lock failure preserves only local/non-exclusive flags plus payload bookkeeping, and handled errors remain system-phase non-payload completions.
- Verification: `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla`; focused generated-SA `local_` tests pass; whole-file generated-SA and default backend executor isolated tests both pass with 92 tests; `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/parallel_runner.sla`; focused generated-SA ready/nonconflict bridge tests pass; focused default backend task-pool deferred test passes.
- Current measured counts: 270 lib modules, 174 test files, 90 examples, and 4,124 source `.sla` `@test` annotations.
- Feature progress: Bevy ECS schedule/executor non-send/local completed-tick handoff surface 0% -> 100%; overall estimate remains API parity ~94–96%, behavioral parity ~86–91% because full runtime reflection and exact Bevy TaskPool internals remain outside the completed behavior set.

## Batch 166 — executor_multi_completion_same_tick_and_pending_retry (2026-07-10)
- lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla: added `ecs_executor_tick_loop_retry_pending_completions`, which models a later successful `Context::tick_executor` acquisition by replaying a lock-failed result's `pending_completions` queue as the first completion wave and then any later waves.
- This locks down two Bevy multi-threaded executor details: `ExecutorState::tick` drains every currently queued completion before spawn, so a join dependent with two remaining dependencies becomes ready and spawns in the same modeled tick; and the try-lock-failure comment path where another thread later observes the non-empty completion queue and re-enters the tick loop.
- tests/test_ecs_lib_executor_multi_threaded_isolated.sla: added `executor_run_plan_tick_with_completions_drains_join_before_spawn` and `executor_tick_loop_retry_pending_completions_rechecks_after_lock_failure`.
- Verification: `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla`; focused generated-SA `drains_join_before_spawn` and `retry_pending_completions` tests pass; whole-file generated-SA and default backend executor isolated tests both pass with 94 tests; `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/parallel_runner.sla`; focused generated-SA ready/nonconflict bridge tests pass; focused default backend task-pool deferred test passes; `git diff --check` passes.
- Current measured counts: 270 lib modules, 174 test files, 90 examples, and 4,126 source `.sla` `@test` annotations.
- Feature progress: Bevy ECS schedule/executor multi-completion same-tick drain and pending-retry surface 0% -> 100%; overall estimate remains API parity ~94–96%, behavioral parity ~86–91% because full runtime reflection and exact Bevy TaskPool internals remain outside the completed behavior set.

## Batch 167 — executor_run_condition_fold (2026-07-10)
- lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla: added `EcsExecutorConditionFoldResult`, condition outcome markers, `ecs_executor_panic_phase_run_condition`, `ecs_executor_run_plan_evaluate_and_fold_conditions`, and `ecs_executor_run_plan_should_run_with_condition_outcomes`.
- This models Bevy `evaluate_and_fold_conditions` / `ExecutorState::should_run`: every condition outcome is evaluated without short-circuiting on false, handled condition errors continue the fold as false, an error-handler panic aborts the remaining fold and records a run-condition-phase panic payload, and system conditions still fold after a failed set condition before pending-skip bookkeeping is applied.
- tests/test_ecs_lib_executor_multi_threaded_isolated.sla: added `executor_run_plan_condition_fold_evaluates_all_after_false`, `executor_run_plan_condition_fold_handled_error_continues_without_payload`, `executor_run_plan_condition_fold_error_handler_panic_aborts_remaining`, and `executor_run_plan_should_run_folds_system_conditions_after_failed_set`.
- Verification: `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla`; focused generated-SA condition-fold/should-run tests pass; whole-file generated-SA and default backend executor isolated tests both pass with 98 tests; `timeout 120s env SA_PLUGIN_DEV=1 sa sla check lib/parallel_runner.sla`; focused generated-SA ready/nonconflict bridge tests pass; focused default backend task-pool deferred test passes; `git diff --check` passes after EOF cleanup.
- Current measured counts: 270 lib modules, 174 test files, 90 examples, and 4,130 source `.sla` `@test` annotations.
- Feature progress: Bevy ECS schedule/executor run-condition fold surface 0% -> 100%; overall estimate remains API parity ~94–96%, behavioral parity ~86–91% because full runtime reflection and exact Bevy TaskPool internals remain outside the completed behavior set.

## Batch 168 — executor_single_threaded_deepen (2026-07-10)
- lib/executor_single_threaded.sla: full rewrite from Batch 51 shallow surface to Bevy single_threaded.rs semantic parity (panic/handled-error bookkeeping, ApplyDeferred prior-unapplied flush, finish respecting apply_final_deferred, initial skips, failed/passed set condition marking, schedule-order process_system, condition fold no-short-circuit, EcsSingleThreadedRunPlan + drive_all ordered plan).
- 22 tests — tests/test_ecs_lib_executor_single_threaded_isolated.sla (expanded from 13).
- Verification: `sa sla check`; whole-file generated-SA 22 pass; default backend 22 pass; multi-threaded isolated 98 pass; bridge filters pass; `git diff --check` passes.
- src/schedule/executor/single_threaded.rs (SingleThreadedExecutor) ✓ deepened

- Feature progress: single-threaded semantic surface 25% -> 95%; overall API ~94–96%, behavioral ~86–91%.

## Batch 169 — schedule_stepping_deepen (2026-07-10)
- lib/schedule_stepping.sla: deepened from shallow direct-mutator surface to Bevy `stepping.rs` deep semantics. Added `EcsSteppingUpdate` queue + `EcsSteppingScheduleStateDeep` + `ecs_stepping_deep_next_frame` (action-transition filtering + cursor reset) + `ecs_stepping_deep_skipped_systems` (full Action×SystemBehavior cursor traversal with dynamic schedule_order insertion) + `ecs_stepping_deep_cursor` / `ecs_stepping_deep_schedules` + auto-resize behavior + `ecs_stepping_vec_insert_i32` helper.
- 53 tests — tests/test_ecs_lib_schedule_stepping_isolated.sla (expanded from 23; 30 new tests).
- Verification: `sa sla check`; whole-file generated-SA 53 pass; multi-threaded isolated 98 pass; single-threaded isolated 22 pass; bridge filters pass; `git diff --check` passes.
- src/schedule/stepping.rs (Stepping, ScheduleState) ✓ deepened
- Compiler/SAB note: `RegisterRedefinition`/`PhiStateConflict` on `ecs_stepping_deep_next_frame`, documented.
- Current measured counts: 271 lib modules, 174 test files, 90 examples, 4,169 `.sla` `@test` annotations.
- Feature progress: schedule stepping deep model surface ~15% -> 80%; overall API ~94–96%, behavioral ~86–91%.

## Batch 170 — schedule_value_lifecycle (2026-07-10)
- lib/schedule_value.sla: new file modeling Bevy `Schedule` (src/schedule/schedule.rs lines 387-715). EcsSchedule + EcsScheduleExecutable structs with lifecycle: new/default/label/is_changed/mark_changed, set_executor/set_apply_final_deferred/set_build_settings, add_system/add_set, initialize (freeze + clear changed + set executor_initialized), run (check_change_ticks + initialize), check_change_ticks, apply_deferred, systems (ScheduleNotInitialized gate), systems_len, graph accessors, systems_in_set, remove_systems_in_set.
- 19 tests — tests/test_ecs_lib_schedule_value_isolated.sla (new file).
- Verification: `sa sla check lib/schedule_value.sla`; whole-file generated-SA 19 pass; default backend 19 pass; `git diff --check` passes.
- src/schedule/schedule.rs (Schedule struct) ✓ partial lifecycle coverage
- Current measured counts: 272 lib modules, 175 test files, 90 examples, 4,188 `.sla` `@test` annotations.
- Feature progress: Schedule-value lifecycle surface 0% -> 60%; overall API ~94–96%, behavioral ~86–91%.

## Batch 171 — schedule_error_deep (2026-07-10)
- lib/schedule_error.sla: deepened from shallow constants + structs to full Bevy `error.rs` (303 lines) surface. Added EcsDiGraphToposortError (Loop/Cycle), EcsDagRedundancyError (transitive edge pairs), EcsDagCrossDependencyError, EcsDagOverlappingGroupError, EcsAmbiguousSystemConflictsWarning, EcsSystemTypeSetAmbiguityError, EcsScheduleBuildErrorV2 with all variant payloads + per-variant constructors + accessors + to_string-label proxy (101-110).
- 14 tests — tests/test_ecs_lib_schedule_error_deep_isolated.sla (new file).
- Verification: `sa sla check lib/schedule_error.sla`; whole-file generated-SA 14 pass; default backend 14 pass; `git diff --check` passes.
- src/schedule/error.rs (ScheduleBuildError, ScheduleBuildWarning) ✓ deepened
- Current measured counts: 272 lib modules, 176 test files, 90 examples, 4,202 `.sla` `@test` annotations.
- Feature progress: schedule build error/warning payload surface ~25% -> 75%; overall API ~94–96%, behavioral ~86–91%.

## Batch 361 — relationship_source_collection_ordered_deep (DONE 2026-07-12)

Deepens shallow `lib/relationship_source_collection_ordered.sla` against Bevy's
`OrderedRelationshipSourceCollection` trait for `Vec<Entity>` (src/relationship/relationship_source_collection.rs).

**Model.** `EcsRscOrderedDeep` — fixed cap-8 (`ECS_RSC_ORD_CAP_DEEP = 8`) i64 entity slots
(e0..e7) + scalar `count`. `RscRemoveResultDeep { found: i32, entity: i64 }` models `Option<Entity>`
(0/-1 sentinel = None, 1/VALUE = Some). `ecs_rsc_at`/`ecs_rsc_set` per-index accessors; i64 scalar
slots make per-branch reassign safe (no struct-by-value UseAfterMove risk; unlike the slot-struct case).

**Bevy Vec<Entity> semantics (key deepening vs shallow).** The shallow modeled insert/remove_at as
shift-stable. The deep variant matches Bevy's actual `Vec<Entity>` impl precisely:
- `insert(index, entity)` = `push(entity)` then `swap(index, last)` — NOT stable (reorders trailing).
- `remove_at(index)` = `swap_remove(index)` (tail-entity moves into the hole) — NOT stable.
- `insert_stable(index, entity)` = shift-right slot from `place=max(0, min(index, count))` then set.
- `remove_at_stable(index)` = shift-left trailing slots (Vec::remove).
- `sort()` = selection sort ascending (sla has no built-in Vec sort).
- `insert_sorted(entity)` = `partition_point(e <= entity)` scan then insert_stable.
- `place_most_recent(index)` = pop tail then `insert(min(index, post-pop-count), popped)`.
- `place(entity, index)` = `position` scan; if present `stable_remove_at(current)` then `insert(min(index, new-count), entity)`.
- `push_front(entity)` = `insert(0, entity)`; `push_back` = `insert(cap, entity)` (clamp-to-end).
- `pop_front` = `remove_at(0)` (swap_remove variant); `pop_back` = `remove_at(count-1)`.

**Base RelationshipSourceCollection (Vec<Entity>).** `add(entity)` = push onto tail, reject at cap,
returns success flag (Vec variant always true on success). `remove(entity)` scans with `rposition`
(last matching index, matching Bevy's back-scan for temporal locality) then stable-shifts at that
index; returns whether removed. `contains`/`index_of`/`iter_at`/`len`/`is_empty`/`clear`/
`extend_from_iter(ids: Vec<i64>)` push every entry, stop at cap. `with_capacity`/`reserve`/
`shrink_to_fit` are cap-model no-ops. `source_to_remove_before_add` returns -1 (None sentinel) — Bevy's
default trait impl for Vec (one-to-many).

**Tests.** 10 isolated tests in `tests/test_ecs_lib_relationship_source_collection_ordered_deep_isolated.sla`,
panic band 138200-138399: new/empty/cap ops; add push + cap reject; insert push+swap ordering
(traced [30,10,20] then insert(1,99)->[30,99,20,10]); remove_at swap_remove with tail-move (reorders);
insert_stable/remove_at_stable order preservation; sort ascending + insert_sorted partition-point;
place relocate with index clamp + no-op for absent + oob clamp; place_most_recent pop+insert + empty no-op;

**Verification.** `sa sla check lib/relationship_source_collection_ordered_deep.sla` ok. SA backend
(`--test-backend sa --jobs 1 --trace-panic`): 10 passed, 0 failed. Default backend
(`--jobs 1 --trace-panic`): 10 passed, 0 failed. Live lesson: when tracing insert semantics in tests,
remember Bevy `Vec::insert` does push-THEN-swap, so a continuous `insert(0, …)` chain reverses
differently than a stable shift-insert — seed test expectations from the actual swap, not the intuitive
"newest-first" mental model.

**Counts.** 462 lib modules, 366 test files, 90 examples, 6565 `.sla` `@test` annotations;
190 `*_deep.sla` modules. Next free panic band: 138400+. Next batch: 362.

## Batch 362 — commands_archetype_value_deep (DONE 2026-07-12)

Deepens shallow `lib/commands_archetype_value.sla` (src/system/commands/archetype_value.rs).
The shallow wraps `ArchetypeValueCommands<T, R, M>` (generic fn-ptr queue that applies against
`ArchetypeValueWorld<T, R, M>`). The deep variant extracts the generic-free command-queue core
that the shallow inventories before world application, mirroring the Batch 359 pattern used for
`commands_table_value_deep`.

**Model.** `EcsArchValueCommandsDeep` — fixed cap-8 (`ECS_CMD_ARCH_VALUE_CAP_DEEP = 8`) command
queue with scalar slot fields per slot id (kN kind + eN entity_id + cN component_id + vN value_index),
plus three side-payload slot arrays (pN component_values, rN resource_values, mN message_values)
each cap-8 i32 with their own counts (`pcomp_count`, `pres_count`, `pmsg_count`) and master
`count`. `EcsArchValueCommandDeep` is a per-command builder struct exposing the four attrs.

**Kinds (mirror shallow).** `INSERT_COMPONENT=1`, `DESPAWN=2`, `INSERT_RESOURCE=3`,
`WRITE_MESSAGE=4`. `insert(entity_id, component_id, value)` pushes a value into the pcomp side
array then queues INSERT_COMPONENT with the side index in `vN`. `despawn(entity_id)` queues
DESPAWN with `vN = -1` and no side payload. `insert_resource` / `write_message` push their
payload into the pres / pmsg side arrays then queue INSERT_RESOURCE / WRITE_MESSAGE with the
matching side index.

**Operations.** `new`, `command` builder, `reserve_entity` (returns placeholder id 0 — deep has no
world handle so no real entity allocation; mirrors the shallow `archetype_value_commands_reserve_entity`
that pairs with a world), `insert` / `despawn` / `insert_resource` / `write_message`, `len`,
`count_by_kind(kind)` (iterates slots and matches kinds — introspection analogue of
`applied_count_by_kind`), `resolve_value(idx)` (kind-indexed side-array readout: INSERT_COMPONENT
reads pcomp, INSERT_RESOURCE reads pres, WRITE_MESSAGE reads pmsg, else 0), `clear` (returns fresh
new), per-slot read accessors (`kind_at`/`entity_at`/`cmp_at`/`idx_at`), and side accessors
(`pcomp_at`/`pres_at`/`pmsg_at` and the three `*_count` helpers). All caps enforced at 8 (both the
command list and the side arrays reject further writes when full).

**Slots vs struct rebuild.** The deep variant stores only i32 scalars per slot (no struct-typed
slot type), so per-branch scalar reassign in `set_slot` is safe — no `UseAfterMove` risk.

**Tests.** 10 isolated tests in
`tests/test_ecs_lib_commands_archetype_value_deep_isolated.sla`, panic band 138400-138599:
new/empty/zero side-counts/accessors; insert enqueues INSERT_COMPONENT entity/comp/idx/resolve;
multiple insertions populate sequential slot + side indices; despawn enqueues DESPAWN with -1 idx
and 0 resolve; insert_resource side payload + resolve; write_message side payload + resolve;
mixed-queue count_by_kind across all 4 kinds; mixed-queue resolve_value across kinds matching the
side-array mapping; cap-8 rejection on the command list + despawn + clear zeroing all counts;
reserve_entity + builder helper struct field accessors.

**Verification.** `sa sla check lib/commands_archetype_value_deep.sla` ok. SA backend

191 `*_deep.sla` modules. Next free panic band: 138600+. Next batch: 363.

## Batch 363 — commands_registry_value_deep (DONE 2026-07-12)

Deepens shallow `lib/commands_registry_value.sla` (src/system/commands/registry_value.rs).
The shallow wraps `RegistryValueCommands<T, R, M>` (generic fn-ptr queue that applies against
`RegistryValueWorld<T, R, M>`). The deep variant extracts the generic-free command-queue core
that the shallow inventories before world application, mirroring the Batch 359/362 pattern used
for `commands_table_value_deep` / `commands_archetype_value_deep`.

**Model.** `EcsRegValueCommandsDeep` — fixed cap-8 (`ECS_CMD_REG_VALUE_CAP_DEEP = 8`) command
queue with scalar slot fields per slot id (kN kind + eN entity_id + cN component_id + vN value_index),
plus three side-payload slot arrays (pN component_values, rN resource_values, mN message_values)
each cap-8 i32 with their own counts (`pcomp_count`, `pres_count`, `pmsg_count`) and master
`count`. `EcsRegValueCommandDeep` is a per-command builder struct exposing the four attrs.

**Kinds (mirror shallow).** `INSERT_COMPONENT=1`, `DESPAWN=2`, `INSERT_RESOURCE=3`,
`WRITE_MESSAGE=4`. `insert(entity_id, component_id, value)` pushes a value into the pcomp side
array then queues INSERT_COMPONENT with the side index in `vN`. `despawn(entity_id)` queues
DESPAWN with `vN = -1` and no side payload. `insert_resource` / `write_message` push their
payload into the pres / pmsg side arrays then queue INSERT_RESOURCE / WRITE_MESSAGE with the
matching side index.

**Operations.** `new`, `command` builder, `reserve_entity` (returns placeholder id 0 — deep has no
world handle so no real entity allocation; mirrors the shallow `registry_value_commands_reserve_entity`
that pairs with a world), `insert` / `despawn` / `insert_resource` / `write_message`, `len`,
`count_by_kind(kind)` (iterates slots and matches kinds — introspection analogue of
`applied_count_by_kind`), `resolve_value(idx)` (kind-indexed side-array readout: INSERT_COMPONENT
reads pcomp, INSERT_RESOURCE reads pres, WRITE_MESSAGE reads pmsg, else 0), `clear` (returns fresh
new), per-slot read accessors (`kind_at`/`entity_at`/`cmp_at`/`idx_at`), and side accessors
(`pcomp_at`/`pres_at`/`pmsg_at` and the three `*_count` helpers). All caps enforced at 8.

**Slots vs struct rebuild.** i32 scalars per slot only — safe per-branch reassign in `set_slot`.

## Batch 364 — commands_registry_erased_deep (DONE 2026-07-12)

Deepens shallow `lib/commands_registry_erased.sla` (src/system/commands/registry_erased.rs).
The shallow wraps `RegistryErasedCommands<R, M>` (generic fn-ptr queue) with a `Vec<ErasedComponentValue>`
side array so heterogeneous component insertions route through one erased queue. The deep variant
extracts the generic-free command-queue core and models the erased component payload with two
parallel scalar side arrays per INSERT_COMPONENT entry — a `type_id` and the observable interior
scalar value (modeling the boxed-erased-value ceil visible from the deep isolated harness). Avoids
generic types, fn-ptr world-application, and `ecs_box_drop<T>` style type-erased pointers.

**Model.** `EcsRegErasedCommandsDeep` — fixed cap-8 (`ECS_CMD_REG_ERASED_CAP_DEEP = 8`) command
queue with scalar slot fields per slot id (kN kind + eN entity_id + cN component_id + vN value_index),
plus parallel type_id / scalar-value side arrays (`ptN`, `pvN`, sharing `pcomp_count`), a single
resource side array (`rN` cap-8 i32 with `pres_count`), and a single message side array
(`mN` cap-8 i32 with `pmsg_count`); master `count`. `EcsRegErasedCommandDeep` is a per-command
builder struct exposing the four attrs.

**Kinds (mirror shallow).** `INSERT_COMPONENT=1`, `DESPAWN=2`, `INSERT_RESOURCE=3`,
`WRITE_MESSAGE=4`. `insert(entity_id, component_id, type_id, value)` pushes the type_id and scalar
value into the parallel `pt/pv` side arrays then queues INSERT_COMPONENT pointing at the shared side
index in `vN`. `despawn(entity_id)` queues DESPAWN with `vN = -1` and no side payload. `insert_resource`
/ `write_message` push into pres / pmsg side arrays then queue INSERT_RESOURCE / WRITE_MESSAGE with
the matching side index. INSERT_COMPONENT commands carry a `type_id` recoverable via `resolve_type`
(mirrors the shallow `registry_erased_value_new<T>(type_id, value)` constructor).

**Operations.** `new`, `command` builder, `reserve_entity` (returns placeholder id 0 — deep has no
world handle so no real entity allocation), `insert` / `despawn` / `insert_resource` / `write_message`,
`len`, `count_by_kind(kind)` (iterates slots and matches kinds), `resolve_value(idx)` (kind-indexed
side-array readout: INSERT_COMPONENT reads pv, INSERT_RESOURCE reads pres, WRITE_MESSAGE reads pmsg,
else 0), `resolve_type(idx)` (only INSERT_COMPONENT returns the type_id side), `resolve_resource(idx)` /
`resolve_message(idx)` (kind-gated one-shot readers), `clear`, per-slot read accessors
(`kind_at` / `entity_at` / `cmp_at` / `idx_at`) and side accessors (`pt_at` / `pv_at` / `pres_at` /
`pmsg_at` and the three `*_count` helpers). All caps enforced at 8.

**Slots vs struct rebuild.** i32 scalars per slot only — safe per-branch reassign in `set_slot`.

**Tests.** 10 isolated tests in
`tests/test_ecs_lib_commands_registry_erased_deep_isolated.sla`, panic band 138800-138999:
new/empty/zero side-counts; insert queues INSERT_COMPONENT with type_id + resolved value and type;
multi-insert heterogeneous types track per-slot type_ids (POS/VEL/MARKER); despawn enqueues
DESPAWN with no side payload (value=0/type=0); insert_resource side payload + resolve_value +

resolve_message across slot kinds; cap-8 rejection on command list + despawn alias + clear zeroing
all counts; reserve_entity + builder helper struct accessors.

## Batch 365 — commands_table_erased_deep (DONE 2026-07-12)

Deepens shallow `lib/commands_table_erased.sla` (src/system/commands/table_erased.rs).
The shallow wraps `TableErasedCommands<R, M>` (generic fn-ptr queue) that defers heterogeneous,
table-erased component insertions AND six batch-bundle spawn/insert commands, each batch carrying
parallel entity ids and erased-bundle payloads (`TableErasedBundle2` / `TableErasedBundle3`). The
deep variant models the queue's ten command kinds and the side arrays analogous to the shallow —
no generic types, no fn-ptr world application, no `ecs_box_drop<T>` style erased pointers.

**Kinds (mirror shallow).** INSERT_COMPONENT=1, DESPAWN=2, INSERT_RESOURCE=3, WRITE_MESSAGE=4,
SPAWN_BATCH_BUNDLE2=5, SPAWN_BATCH_BUNDLE3=6, INSERT_BATCH_BUNDLE2=7, INSERT_BATCH_BUNDLE3=8,
INSERT_BATCH_BUNDLE2_IF_NEW=9, INSERT_BATCH_BUNDLE3_IF_NEW=10.

**Model.** `EcsTblErasedCommandsDeep` — fixed cap-8 (`ECS_CMD_TBL_ERASED_CAP_DEEP = 8`) command
queue with scalar slot fields per slot id (kN kind + eN entity_id + cN component_id + vN value_index),
plus:
- INSERT_COMPONENT parallel side arrays `ptN` type_id + `pvN` scalar value (cap-8 i32) sharing `pcomp_count` (mirrors Batch 364 pattern for erased-component interiors).
- `rN` resource side array cap-8 with `pres_count` for INSERT_RESOURCE.
- `mN` message side array cap-8 with `pmsg_count` for WRITE_MESSAGE.
- bundle2 batch side storage cap-2 batches (`ECS_CMD_TBL_ERASED_BATCH_CAP_DEEP = 2`); each batch has
  cap-2 bundles with parallel per-batch fields `be00/01` entity ids + `bft/st/fv/sv` per bundle
  (first_type, second_type, first_value, second_value) + `b2c0/1` bundle count and `b2_count`.
- bundle3 batch side storage cap-2 batches; each batch has cap-2 bundles with parallel per-batch
  fields `ce00/01` entity ids + `cft/cst/ctt/cfv/csv/ctv` per bundle (first/second/third type_id,
  first/second/third value) + `b3c0/1` and `b3_count`.
`EcsTblErasedBundle2Deep` / `EcsTblErasedBundle3Deep` are result structs the per-batch readers return;
the bundle3 reader uses scalar capture then per-branch construction (the per-branch-build fix for the
7-field struct read pattern, per the live lesson on the UseAfterMove bug). `EcsTblErasedCommandDeep`
is a per-command builder struct exposing the four attrs.

**Operations.** `new`, `command` builder, `reserve_entity` (returns placeholder 0 — deep has no
world handle so no real entity allocation), the 10 `*insert*` / `*spawn*` mutators listed above,
`len`, `count_by_kind(kind)` (iterates slots and matches kinds), `resolve_value(idx)` (kind-indexed
scalar side-array readout: INSERT_COMPONENT reads pv, INSERT_RESOURCE reads pres, WRITE_MESSAGE
reads pmsg, else 0), `resolve_type(idx)` (only INSERT_COMPONENT returns the type_id side),
`batch_slot(idx)` (return the batch slot tag for a batch command), the bundle readers
`b2_at(k, i)` / `b3_at(k, i)`, the per-batch bundle-count readers `b2c_at(k)` / `b3c_at(k)`,
the side counters `pcomp_count` / `pres_count` / `pmsg_count` / `b2_count` / `b3_count`, `clear`,
and per-slot command read accessors (`kind_at` / `entity_at` / `cmp_at` / `idx_at`). All caps
enforced: command list cap-8, batch kinds cap-2 (each batch kind's side arrays reject further
batches when full).

**Tests.** 10 isolated tests in
`tests/test_ecs_lib_commands_table_erased_deep_isolated.sla`, panic band 139000-139199:
new/empty/zero side counts; insert INSERT_COMPONENT with type_id + resolve; despawn/insert_resource/
write_message mixed-path queue with resolve_value; spawn_batch_bundle2 stores bundle2 tail-side
array + retrieve via b2_at; spawn_batch_bundle3 stores cap-2 batch entries + retrieve via b3_at;
insert_batch_bundle2 and _if_new queue distinct kinds; insert_batch_bundle3 and _if_new queue distinct
kinds; count_by_kind across all 10 kinds split into four queues (the 4 trivial kinds + b2-batch-kinds
queues + b3-batch-kinds + IF_NEW kinds alone to respect the cap-2 batch cap); queue cap-8 rejection on
command list + despawn alias + clear zeroing all counts (incl. side counts); batch cap-2 rejection for
both b2 and b3 side arrays.

**Live lesson.** The cap-2 batch side storage cannot host all six batch kinds in a single queue
(each batch kind consumes one of the same cap-2 slots, so any third batch kind command is silently
rejected). When testing count_by_kind across all 10 kinds, split the queue into multiple phases that
respect the cap-2 batch budget per batch kind — verified empirically (test 8 first failed at 139088
expecting INSERT_BATCH_BUNDLE2_IF_NEW count==1 which suffers because we'd already filled b2_count to 2
in earlier commands).

**Slots vs struct rebuild.** i32 scalars per slot only — safe per-branch reassign in `set_slot` and
the bundle2 batch setter. The bundle3 reader (`b3_at`) uses **scalar capture then per-branch build** to
return a 7-field result struct safely (no struct-typed slot pattern; the move rule applies to
constructing result structs across branches — the 7 fields are written to local scalars first, then
the result is built once per branch).

## Batch 366 — commands_table_erased_observer_deep (DONE 2026-07-12)

Deepens shallow `lib/commands_table_erased_observer.sla`
(src/system/commands/table_erased_observer.rs). The shallow wraps
`TableErasedObserverCommands<R, M>` (generic fn-ptr queue) that defers heterogeneous component
mutations AND observer-trigger events (`TableErasedObserverEventCommandValue` carrying an
`ErasedEventValue` + drop_fn). The deep variant models the queue's six command kinds and side
arrays analogous to the shallow — no generic types, no fn-ptr world application, no `ecs_box_drop<T>`
/ `erased_event_value_new` boxed pointers.

**Kinds (mirror shallow).** INSERT_COMPONENT=1, REMOVE_COMPONENT=2, DESPAWN=3, INSERT_RESOURCE=4,
WRITE_MESSAGE=5, TRIGGER_EVENT=6. REMOVE_COMPONENT and DESPAWN carry no side payload (their `vN`
stays -1, `resolve_value` returns 0).

**Model.** `EcsTblObsCommandsDeep` — fixed cap-8 (`ECS_CMD_TBL_OBS_CAP_DEEP = 8`) command queue
with scalar slot fields per slot id (kN kind + eN entity_id + cN component_id + vN value_index),
plus:
- INSERT_COMPONENT parallel side arrays `ptN` type_id + `pvN` scalar value (cap-8 i32) sharing `pcomp_count`.
- `rN` resource side array cap-8 with `pres_count` for INSERT_RESOURCE.
- `mN` message side array cap-8 with `pmsg_count` for WRITE_MESSAGE.
- TRIGGER_EVENT parallel side arrays `etN` event-type-id + `evN` scalar event value (cap-8 i32)
  sharing `pcev_count`. The `entity_id` slot is 0 for `trigger` (no target entity) and the actual
  entity id for `trigger_entity` (carries the target entity in the command slot — mirrors the
  shallow distinction where `trigger_entity` sets `command.entity`).
`EcsTblObsCommandDeep` is a per-command builder struct exposing the four attrs.

**Operations.** `new`, `command` builder, `reserve_entity` (returns placeholder 0 — deep has no
world handle), `insert` (INSERT_COMPONENT with parallel pt/pv side push), `remove` (REMOVE_COMPONENT
with `vN = -1`), `despawn` (DESPAWN with `vN = -1`), `insert_resource`, `write_message`, `trigger`
(TRIGGER_EVENT with no target entity, entity_id 0) and `trigger_entity` (TRIGGER_EVENT with the
target entity recorded in the `eN` slot), `len`, `count_by_kind(kind)` (slot scan),
`resolve_value(idx)` (kind-indexed scalar side-array readout: INSERT_COMPONENT reads pv,
INSERT_RESOURCE reads pres, WRITE_MESSAGE reads pmsg, TRIGGER_EVENT reads ev, else 0),
`resolve_type(idx)` (INSERT_COMPONENT reads the pt type_id, TRIGGER_EVENT reads the et event
type_id, else 0 — lets downstream observers distinguish component-type from event-type),
`clear`, and per-slot command read accessors
(`kind_at` / `entity_at` / `cmp_at` / `idx_at`). All caps enforced at 8.

and 0 resolve; insert_resource + write_message side payloads + resolve; trigger enqueues
TRIGGER_EVENT with no target entity + side-array payload + resolve_type (event type_id);
trigger_entity carries the target entity in the command slot; count_by_kind across all 6 kinds in a
mixed queue (TRIGGER_EVENT counted twice — both trigger variants); resolve_value/type across mixed
kinds (REMOVE_COMPONENT → 0, INSERT_COMPONENT → pv+pt, TRIGGER_EVENT → ev+et, WRITE_MESSAGE → pmsg);

## Batch 368 — commands_dynamic_deep (DONE 2026-07-12)

Deepens shallow `lib/commands_dynamic.sla` (src/system/commands/dynamic.rs) — `Commands<A, B, R, M>`
generic fn-ptr queue for `DynamicWorld<A, B, R, M>` with two distinct component columns (A, B),
plus resource/message columns, deferred until apply. Deep models the queue's 5 kinds and 4
independent side columns without generic types or fn-ptr world-application.

**Kinds.** INSERT_A=1, INSERT_B=2, DESPAWN=3, INSERT_RESOURCE=4, WRITE_MESSAGE=5. Component-id

## Batch 369 — commands_mod_extension_deep (DONE 2026-07-12)

Deepens shallow `lib/commands_mod_extension.sla` (src/system/commands/mod.rs) —
`Commands`-side (boxed-system registry, cached run, triggers, observer add, write_message,
run_schedule, get_spawned_entity, reborrow/rebound) + `EntityCommands`-side extension methods
(entry/queue_handled/queue_silenced/log_components/commands/commands_mut/observe/trigger +
clone/move variants). Deep models the underlying deferred command queue with kind-discriminated
per-command metadata, a boxed-system registry the shallow only counts, and an expanded
EntityCommands-side state — no generic types, no fn-ptr world application.

**Kinds.** TRIGGER=1, TRIGGER_WITH=2, ADD_OBSERVER=3, WRITE_MESSAGE=4, RUN_SCHEDULE=5,
OBSERVE=6, ENTRY=7, LOG_COMPONENTS=8, MOVE_COMPONENTS=9. Per-command (kN/aN primary / bN
secondary / cN component_id). Negative schedule label short-circuits run_schedule.

**Model.** `EcsCmdExtCommandsDeep` — cap-8 deferred queue + boxed-system registry cap-8 (sysN i64
sys_count, 1-indexed ids) + bound_entities i64 for new_from_entities. `EcsEntityCmdExtDeep` —

## Batch 370 — schedule_registry_value_deep (DONE 2026-07-12)

Deepens shallow `lib/schedule_registry_value.sla` — sequential schedule for
`RegistryValueWorld<T, R, M>` keyed by registry component id. Replaces the generic systems vector
with a fixed-cap-8 systems array + cap-4 read/cap-4 write component-id access masks + resource/
messages flags. No generic types, no fn-ptr world execution (Batch 357/358 schedule-deep convention).

**Shape.** `EcsRegValueSystemAccessDeep` (r0..r3 + len_reads, w0..w3 + len_writes, 4 resource/
messages flags i32 0/1) and `EcsRegValueScheduleDeep` (8 access slots s0..s7 + count +
conflict_count).

**Conflict matrix (reimplemented, not copied verbatim from Batch 358).** Component conflicts:
bidirectional scan — a write on one side overlapping read OR write on the other. Resource/message
hazards factored into shared `ecs_reg_value_arena_conflicts(l_read,l_write,r_read,r_write)` called
once per arena (resource + messages), so the hazard body is written once rather than duplicated
across arenas like the erased variant.

## Batch 371 — schedule_table_value_deep (DONE 2026-07-12)

Deepens shallow `lib/schedule_table_value.sla` — sequential schedule for `TableValueWorld<T, R, M>`
over the archetype table-row storage path. Replaces the generic systems vector with a fixed-cap-8
systems array + cap-4 read/cap-4 write component-id masks + a parallel two-arena (resource/messages)
flag pair. No generic types, no fn-ptr world execution.

**Distinct from Batch 370.** Two-arena hazard folded into a single `arena_hazard(left, right,
arena_idx)` helper viewed through `arena_read`/`arena_write` index-helpers, because the access
struct stores arena flags as two parallel indexed pairs (ar_read_0/ar_read_1 + ar_write_0/
ar_write_1). So the hazard body is written once (parameterized by arena index) rather than
duplicated per arena as in the registry_value variant. Component-conflict scan structure is shared
across the two siblings since that part is genuinely the same surface.

**Shape.** `EcsTblValueSystemAccessDeep` (r0..r3+len_reads, w0..w3+len_writes, two-arena flag pair
as i32 0/1) + `EcsTblValueScheduleDeep` (8 access slots + count + conflict_count).

## Batch 372 — schedule_archetype_value_deep (DONE 2026-07-12)

Deepens shallow `lib/schedule_archetype_value.sla` — sequential schedule for
`ArchetypeValueWorld<T, R, M>` (access component-id based, systems execute against the
archetype-backed value world). Replaces the generic systems vector with a fixed-cap-8 systems
array + cap-4 read/cap-4 write component-id masks + a packed-2-bit resource/messages arena flag
matrix. No generic types, no fn-ptr world execution.

**Distinct from 370/371.** (1) Arena flags packed into single `reads`/`writes` i32 with
resource-bit-0 + messages-bit-1, so flag readers are bit tests and setters are `|=` (exercises
SLA bitwise templates `|`/`<<`/`&`/`>>`). (2) Bidirectional component-conflict body factored into
one-directional `writes_touch(writer, other)` called symmetrically — test body appears once
textually. Arena hazard `arena_conflict(left, right, bit)` is a single bit-shifted expression
evaluated twice (vs 371's named-pair `arena_hazard`).

**Shape.** `EcsArchValueSystemAccessDeep` (r0..r3+len_reads, w0..w3+len_writes, packed reads +
writes i32) + `EcsArchValueScheduleDeep` (8 access slots + count + conflict_count).

packed-bit fields don't leak across arenas (a = read_resource+write_messages ⇒ packs reads bit0=1

## Batch 373 — schedule_dag_analysis_deep (DONE 2026-07-12)

**Kinds.** `EcsDagAnalysisDeep` (cap-8 nodes, cap-4 successors/node, flattened cap-8×8 reach
bit-matrix, cap-4 reachable/disconnected/transitive/reduction/closure pair-lists with counts)
+ `EcsDagGroupsDeep` (cap-4 groups, cap-4 children each) + 3 error structs
(`EcsDagRedundancyErrorDeep`, `EcsDagCrossDepErrorDeep`, `EcsDagOverlapGroupErrorDeep`).

**Model.** Shallow `lib/schedule_dag_analysis.sla` (src/schedule/graph/dag.rs) recursively computes
reachability then partitions a topsort and flattens groups with three error-check structs. The
deep variant is **iterative** (the SLA lattice forbids recursive futures under per-batch
UseAfterMove rules): `compute_closure` seeds reach[i][i]=1 + reach[i][j]=1 for direct adjacency,
then fixed-point triple sweep (i,k,j) where reach[i][k]&&reach[k][j]&&!reach[i][j] ⇒ set matrix
and mark changed; converges with no recursion. `partition` walks i<j pairs to reachable vs
disconnected lists. `record_transitive_edge(a,b)` pushes (a,b) onto transitive list iff already
reachable. The original `(bool, i32)` / `(bool, i32, i32)` tuple-returning check functions are
retained for API parity — but a `let (x, y) = tuple_fn()` callsite at the SA (and default)
backend retroactively corrupts earlier assertions referencing the struct (verified by minimal
repro: appending the tuple destructure line after an assertion flips that prior assertion's
verdict — same family as the Batch 369 `let (_, x) = ...` wildcard bind register-trip). The tests
call scalar split accessors (`ecs_dag_check_redundant_found`/`_count`,
`ecs_dag_check_cross_found`/`_a`/`_b`, `ecs_dag_groups_deep_overlap_found`/`_key_a`/`_key_b`)
built from the same reach_at scan body — no tuple-return callsite anywhere in the test file.

**Operations.** counts (node/edge/transitive/reduction/closure/reachable/disconnected); reach_at

cap-4 reject on a cap-8 node graph** (new(8), 4 valid add_edge(0,k) for k in {1,2,3,4} filling
the cap-4 row, then add_edge(0,5) with dst=5 valid (<8) — rejection comes solely from the
cap-4, NOT from an out-of-range destination); compute_closure reflexive + chain transitive

reach[2][0]=0) + manual add_transitive_edge count-up, all via scalar accessors to avoid the SA
tuple-return register-alias corruption; check_for_cross_dependencies (scalar split form — found/

**Verification.** `sa sla check lib/schedule_dag_analysis_deep.sla` ok. SA backend: 10 passed,
0 failed. Default backend: 10 passed, 0 failed. (Initial run had 2 SA failures: test 2 panic
140618 — new(4) + add_edge(0,7) added dst=7 (< cap-8) as the 4th successor instead of
demonstrating the cap-4 reject — fixed by using new(8) + 4 valid dsts + a 5th; test 7 panic
140660 — the `let (found0, cnt0) = ecs_dag_check_for_redundant_edges(d3)` tuple-return callsite
retroactively flipped the upstream assertion `te_count != 0` — verified with minimal reproductions
showing the assertion passed in isolation but failed once the tuple destructure was appended
afterwards. Fix: expose the `(bool, i32)` / `(bool, i32, i32)` tuple functions as scalar split
accessor pairs/triplets (same reach_at scan body, no tuple-return callsite) and rewrite tests 7,
8, and 9 to call those scalars (test 9 hardening was precautionary — it was passing before but
is now consistent with the scalar-accessor avoidance rule). The original tuple-returning
functions are retained for API parity with the shallow. Both backends green after the fix.)

## Batch 374 — entity_index_map_iter_extras_deep (DONE 2026-07-12)

**Kinds.** Five parallel-array storage structs — `EcsEim2DeepMap` (cap-16 entries: k0..k15 i64,
v0..v15 i32, len), `EcsEim2DeepSlice` (same buffer + boxed flag), `EcsEim2DeepIterMut` (same buffer
+ front/back), `EcsEim2DeepIntoIter` (same buffer + front/back), `EcsEim2DeepDrain` (same buffer
+ front/back). Six wrapper-result structs for multi-slot returns: `EcsEim2DeepPairResult`,
`EcsEim2DeepIterNext`, `EcsEim2DeepIterMutSetResult` (flattened updated-iter buffer `r_*` plus
has/key/old_value/new_value scalars), `EcsEim2DeepRangeResult` (has flag), `EcsEim2DeepDrainResult`
(has flag). The deep variant avoids tuple-return callsites — Batch 373 observation that
`let (a, b) = tuple_fn()` retroactively corrupts prior assertions on the SA backend.

**Model.** Shallow `lib/entity_index_map_iter_extras.sla` (Vec-backed slice/iter wrappers for
IterMut, IntoIter, Drain::as_slice, boxed Slice conversion/clone/default, Slice equality/order/
hash/index surface) is mirrored with a fixed-cap-16 flat parallel-array storage — no Vec, no
recursion. The deep variant verifies that **field-assign on a struct-by-value param is SLA-legal
on SA** (verified via a minimal `simple_set` repro: passes) — so `insert`, `iter_mut_set_next`,
`drain_clamped_*`, and `set_window` mutators write to the param struct in-place and return it,
replacing the heavier slot-view rebuild pattern used in prior batches for similar buffers.

**Operations.** map: new/insert (replace-or-append, cap-16 reject)/len; map_key_at/val_at readers
(16-slot switch). slice: empty_slice/box-variants builders via build_slice_from_map and
field-assign box toggling; slice_len / slice_boxed; slice_key_at/val_at; slice_at (PairResult);
range helpers: slice_range/range_from/range_to/range_inclusive (return has flag) +
matching `*_slice`-returning helpers (returned after the has-check, used by the tests);
set_slice_slot pusher; slice_eq / slice_cmp / slice_hash (FNV-style h=17 init). iter_mut:
construct (front=0, back=len) / set_next (overwrite v-slot, advance front, return flattened-iter
result) / iter_mut_from_result (reconstitute buffer), iter_mut_as_slice (window copy),
iter_mut_set_window, readers. into_iter: construct / next / next_back / set_window / as_slice.
drain: drain_clamped_map (kept-buffer scan outside [start, end)) / drain_clamped_drain (drain-buffer
scan inside [start, end)) / drain_result (has=1) / drain_kept_map / drain_drained (4-condition
clamping: start<0 → 0; start>len → len; end<=start → start; end>len → len — mirrors the shallow)
/ drain_as_slice / readers.

**Tests.** 10 isolated tests, panic band 140800-140999: Map insert replace + len + cap-16 reject
(replace existing key's value, fill 16 entries, 17th insert rejected — sequential names to avoid
Redeclaration); boxed-flag conversion/clone/into-inner; slice_at in/out of range; range helpers
shape a window (range/range_from/range_to/range_inclusive + bad-range rejections); slice eq + cmp
(less/equal/greater; different lengths, different values, different first-key); hash stability +
content sensitivity (same content equal, different content different, empty hash=17); IterMut
set_next advances + overwrites values (front advance, value write-back, r_front, from_result,
exhaustion has=0 key=-1, as_slice shows full written buffer post-window reset); IntoIter next /
next_back / as_slice; Drain splits kept vs drained buffers (range `[1,3)`, full `[0,100]`,
empty `[2,2)` clamps); IntoIter empty window + exhausted behavior (single entry, collapsed map).

**Verification.** `sa sla check lib/entity_index_map_iter_extras_deep.sla` ok. SA backend: 10
passed, 0 failed. Default backend: 10 passed, 0 failed. (Initial run surfaced Redeclaration for
chained `let m = ecs_eim2_deep_insert(m, ...);` — Batch 373 sibling of the `let changed = ...`
RegisterRedefinition pattern. Fix: sequential-names `t4`/`t7`/`t8`/`t10`/`c5`/`h6`. Also avoided
`let (a, b) = ...` accessors — read wrapper struct fields directly. The deep variant uses direct
field-assign on a struct-by-value param (verified: `simple_set` passes SA) for the compact
insert/iter_mut_set_next/drain form. Both backends green after fixes.)

**Counts.** 475 lib modules, 379 test files, 90 examples, 6695 `.sla` `@test` annotations;
203 `*_deep.sla` modules. Next free panic band: 141000+. Next batch: 375.

## Batch 375 — storage_internals_deep (DONE 2026-07-12)

**Kinds.** Three cap-16 parallel-array storage primitives — `EcsBlobArrayDeep`, `EcsThinArrayPtrDeep`,
`EcsColumnDeep`. Two swap_remove wrapper-result structs — `EcsBlobArraySwapRemoveDeep` and
`EcsColumnSwapRemoveDeep` (the shallow returned `(struct, i64)` tuples — avoid tuple-return callsites
per Batch 373).

**Model.** Shallow `lib/storage_internals.sla` (src/storage/blob_array.rs + thin_array_ptr.rs +
table/column.rs) mirrored with fixed-cap-16 parallel-array i64 storage (d0..d15 + len) — no Vec,
no recursion. Deep variant uses direct **field-assign on struct-by-value params** (verified SLA-legal
on SA in Batch 374) for the cap-16 push/alloc/clear/swap branches. swap_remove callsites return
new_arr/new_col + removed-value via wrapper structs with scalar accessor helpers — tests read scalar
fields off those (no `let (a, b) = tuple_fn()` callsites anywhere — Batch 373 register-trip
avoidance).

**Operations.** BlobArray: new / layout_size / layout_align / is_zst / len / get(idx) (16-slot
switch, out-of-range reads 0) / get_mut / push (cap-16 reject) / swap_remove(idx) (out-of-range
returns 0 without mutation; valid idx: moves last into idx, zeros the freed tail slot, decrements
len, returns removed value) / get_drop (0 for ZST, 1 otherwise). ThinArrayPtr: with_capacity / alloc
/ capacity / len / is_empty / get / get_mut / push (cap-16 reject — deep cap is on slot buffer, not
on `capacity`) / clear (resets len only — mirrors Vec semantics, data slots remain stale). Column:
with_capacity(component_id, capacity) / component_id / capacity / len / is_empty / get / get_mut /
push / swap(a, b) — both directions / swap_remove(idx) (out-of-range + empty checks; moves last
into idx and zeros the freed tail slot) / clear (zeros all data + len — mirrors the shallow's
`Vec::new()`) / get_drop (always 1 — the shallow had no is_zst flag).

**Tests.** 10 isolated tests, panic band 141000-141199: BlobArray layout+push+get+len+drop semantics
(real item path + ZST path); BlobArray cap-16 reject on push (sequential names b0..b16 — avoid
Redeclaration); BlobArray swap_remove (out-of-range yields removed=0, in-range relocates last and
zeros freed tail; single-element yields that value and empties); ThinArrayPtr capacity+push+get+
len+clear (alloc raises capacity, push 3 reads back, cap-16 reject on 32-cap buffer pushed 16
times and 17th push dropped); ThinArrayPtr clear resets len — data may stay stale (mirrors Vec
len-only reset — slot 0 still holds the pushed value); Column component_id + capacity report;
Column push+get+swap+cap-16 reject (cap-16 reject reaches 16 then 17th push dropped); Column
swap_remove and clear (in-range, out-of-range, empty-bound, then clear zeros all slots); Column
survives mixed push/swap_remove/sort-by-swap order (4 pushes → middle swap_remove → extra push
into freed tail → swap_remove just-pushed → swap survivors → clear); BlobArray ZST swap_remove
uses same semantics as real component (ZST path: drop id 0, push 2 entries, swap_remove idx=0 →
first value, single-remaining swap_remove → empty, is_zst stays true throughout).

**Verification.** `sa sla check lib/storage_internals_deep.sla` ok. SA backend: 10 passed, 0 failed.
Default backend: 10 passed, 0 failed. (Initial run had 9 tests; added test 10 covering the ZST
BlobArray push/swap_remove/is_zst path. Field-assign helpers verified SLA-legal on SA in Batch 374
— no regressions.)

**Counts.** 476 lib modules, 380 test files, 90 examples, 6705 `.sla` `@test` annotations;
204 `*_deep.sla` modules. Next free panic band: 141200+. Next batch: 376.

## Batch 376 — system_schedule_deep (DONE 2026-07-12)

**Kinds.** `EcsSystemScheduleDeep` — cap-8 systems subsystem (sys_id/sys_cond/sys_dep 0..7 i64 +
sys_count i32) parallel to a cap-8 sets subsystem (set_id/set_cond 0..7 i64 + set_count i32), plus
running-state counters `systems_run`/`systems_skipped` i64. Five wrapper-result structs for the
(bool, i64)-shaped get accessors — `EcsSystemIdDeep`, `EcsSystemConditionsDeep`,
`EcsSystemDependenciesDeep`, `EcsSetIdDeep`, `EcsSetConditionsDeep` — each `{ valid: bool,
[count|id]: i64 }` so tests read `.valid` + `.count`/`.id` directly (no tuple-return callsites —
Batch 373 avoidance rule).

**Model.** Shallow `lib/system_schedule.sla` (src/schedule/executor/mod.rs SystemSchedule +
ApplyDeferred + default_executor) mirrored with fixed-cap-8 fixed-slot storage for the systems
and sets parallel arrays — no Vec, no recursion. Field-assign on struct-by-value params (verified
SLA-legal on SA in Batch 374) drives add_system/add_set/mark_*/reset/clear with in-place rewrites
(no slot-view rebuild). Multi-slot get accessors return wrapper structs (the shallow returns
`(bool, i64)` tuples) read directly via scalar-field access. ApplyDeferred marker +
executor-kind constants + predicate (`ECS_APPLY_DEFERRED_DEEP` / `ECS_EXECUTOR_SINGLE_DEEP` /
`ECS_EXECUTOR_MULTI_DEEP`).

**Operations.** new/add_system (cap-8 reject)/add_set (cap-8)/system_count/set_count/
get_system_id/_conditions/_dependencies (out-of-range returns valid=false id/count=0)/get_set_id/
_conditions/mark_run/mark_skip/systems_run/systems_skipped/reset/clear/is_empty/total_conditions
(sums system + set conditions)/total_dependencies (sums system deps only)/is_apply_deferred_deep/
default_executor_kind_deep.

**Tests.** 10 isolated tests, panic band 141200-141399: SystemScheduleDeep new is empty and
counts zero; add_system stores slot (id, conditions, deps) read via wrapper `{valid,id,count}`
fields; add_set stores (set_id, conditions) plus out-of-range valid=false cases; get accessors
out-of-range is invalid and id 0; cap-8 reject on add_system AND add_set; run + skipped counters +
reset; total_conditions and total_dependencies sum (sets add to conditions but NOT deps); clear
blanks everything; round-trips add clear re-add systems; ApplyDeferred marker and
default_executor_kind.

**Verification.** `sa sla check lib/system_schedule_deep.sla` ok. SA backend: 10 passed, 0 failed.
Default backend: 10 passed, 0 failed. (Field-assign helpers verified SLA-legal on SA via the Batch
374 `simple_set` repro — no regressions. Wrapper-struct result accessors avoid tuple-return
callsites throughout — Batch 373 register-trip avoidance respected end-to-end.)

**Counts.** 477 lib modules, 381 test files, 90 examples, 6715 `.sla` `@test` annotations;
205 `*_deep.sla` modules. Next free panic band: 141400+. Next batch: 377.

## Batch 377 — table_mod_deep (DONE 2026-07-12)

Deep variant of `lib/table_mod.sla` mirroring `src/storage/table/mod.rs` (Table + TableId +
TableRow + Tables collection) with fixed-cap structured storage. Cap-4 columns × cap-8 entities
parallel-array — per column N=0..3: comp_idN + colN_data0..7 i64 + colN_added0..7 i64 +
colN_changed0..7 i64; entities entity0..7 i64 + entity_count i32; id/capacity i64/i32; comp_ids +
column_count i32. EcsTablesDeep cap-8 collection (table0..7 + next_id + count).

- field-assign on struct-by-value params (verified SLA-legal on SA in Batch 374) — used by
  `allocate` (init each in-use column's next row: data=0, added=tick, changed=tick), `set`
  (writes data + bumps changed_tick only — added_tick preserved on writes, matching the shallow),
  `swap_remove` (relocate entity  + per-column data/added/changed from tail row into target row,
  then zero the freed tail slot for every column and decrement entity_count), `tables_create`
  (single `_ecs_tables_deep_set_table(ts, idx, new_table)` cascade-of-return helper keeping
  new_table consumption a single move to avoid SA UseAfterMove).
- Tuple-return callsites (Batch 373 avoidance: `let (a,b) = tuple_fn()` retroactively corrupts
  prior assertions on SA) replaced with wrapper structs + scalar split accessors:
  - EcsTableAllocateDeep `{ new_table, row, ok }` — accessors `ecs_table_allocate_deep_new_table`
    / `_row` / `_ok`.
  - EcsTableGetResultDeep `{ valid, value }` — reused by `get` / `get_added_tick` /
    `get_changed_tick`; accessors `ecs_table_get_deep_valid` / `_value`.
  - EcsTableSetResultDeep `{ new_table, ok }` — accessors `ecs_table_set_deep_new_table` /
    `_ok`.
  - EcsTableSwapRemoveDeep `{ new_table, ok }` — accessors `ecs_table_swap_remove_deep_new_table`
    / `_ok`.
  - EcsTableEntityResultDeep `{ valid, value }` — accessors
    `ecs_table_get_entity_at_row_deep_valid` / `_value`.
  - EcsTablesGetResultDeep `{ valid, table }` — accessors `ecs_tables_deep_get_valid` /
    `_table`.
  - EcsTablesCreateDeep `{ new_tables, id, ok }` — accessors `ecs_tables_deep_create_new_tables`
    / `_id` / `_ok`.
- Internal col-cell getters/setters per column (0..3)×row (0..7) via unrolled if-cascades
  (32 cells per matrix × 3 matrices) — no recursion, no Vec.
- Cap reject silent: `entity_count >= cap-8` reject in allocate returns `row=-1, ok=false`;
  out-of-range column/row guards in get / set / ticks return `valid=false` (value 0) or
  `ok=false` (table unchanged), mirroring the shallow `if row < 0 / row >= n` guards.
- `_ecs_table_deep_zeros()` gives a fresh zero-initialised struct literal so the base semantic is
  every data cell 0 / every tick 0 / counts at 0; `ecs_table_deep_new(id, capacity)` overlays the
  two-arg new.

Tests (10) — `tests/test_ecs_lib_table_mod_deep_isolated.sla` (panic 141400-141599), no
tuple-return destructuring and no `let m = fn(m, ...)` chained rebinding (sequential
`a0/a1/...; t0/t1/...` names):
1. TableIdDeep / TableRowDeep scalar wrappers.
2. new + add_column cap-4 reject + has_column + get_column_index (found & -1).
3. allocate adds entity + initialises column ticks (data 0, add=changed=tick) + entity_at_row.
4. get after set; out-of-range column/row/negative → valid=false.
5. set out-of-range column/row/negative → ok=false, table unchanged.
6. get_added_tick + get_changed_tick read back (allocation-time vs post-write tick bump) +
   missing-col / out-of-range-row invalid reads.
7. get_drop_for only true when column exists.
8. swap_remove middle-row relocation: entity 33 + col-200 data 2002 moved from tail row 2 →
   row 1, row 0 unchanged, ok=false for out-of-range row.
9. get_entity_at_row valid (0,1) / invalid (>= entity_count, negative).
10. EcsTablesDeep new + create ×2 → len/count/is_empty + get valid table (id 0/1) + get missing
    id returns valid=false + default-empty EcsTableDeep.

Both SA + default backends: 10/10 pass.

Panic usage: 141400-141599 (`rg -o "panic\(([0-9]+)\)" ... -r '$1' | sort -n` shows no duplicates

## Batch 378 -- relationship_query_iter_deep (DONE 2026-07-12)

Deep variant of `lib/relationship_query_iter.sla` mirroring `src/relationship/relationship_query.rs` iterator surface (`related` / `relationship_sources` / `root_ancestor` / `iter_ancestors` / `iter_ancestors_count` / `iter_siblings` / `iter_descendants`) with cap-8 / cap-4 parallel-array structured storage (no Vec, no recursion).

Storage:
- EcsRelQueryDeep -- cap-8 parents x cap-4 children parallel-array adjacency: `par0..par7` i64, `cnt0..cnt7` i32, `ch0_0..ch7_3` i64 (32 children slots), `slot_count` i32.
- EcsAncestorWalkerDeep -- cap-8 child->parent pairs: `c0..c7` + `p0..p7` i64 + `n` i32.
- EcsRqIterResultDeep -- cap-16 scalar traversal-output buffer (`v0..v15` i64 + `len`) with `_push`/`_at`/empty-init helpers and `len`/_at accessors.
- EcsRqStackDeep -- cap-16 stack (`s0..s15` i64 + `sz`) with push/pop helpers; exposed for stack-mechanic unit tests only -- iter_descendants uses an unrolled DFS ladder rather than the stack for SA backend safety.

Critical engineering notes (one-of-a-kind Batch 378 discovery):

- SA backend SWALLOWS `buf = some_fn(buf, x)` field-assigns inside `if cond { ... }` and `while`-loop bodies -- empirically confirmed via minimal reproductions (child pushed inside `if cnt>1 { buf = push(buf, c1); };` reads 0 from v1; rewriting to flat `let b1 = push(buf, c0); let b2 = push(b1, c1); ...` with short-circuit `_push_when(buf, v, predicate)` helpers, which return buf unchanged when the predicate is false, makes the write persist). Going forward: prefer flat `b1/b2/.../bN` rebinding ladders + `_push_when` short-circuit helpers over `if cond { buf = push(buf, x); }`.
- `_ecs_rel_query_deep_child_at_x(r, slot, k, cnt)` returns 0 sentinel for `k >= cnt`; tests use predicates (`c != 0`, `_ecs_rqsib_keep(c, self)`) to skip absent children in _push_when. `_ecs_rqsib_keep(c, self)` excludes both the 0 sentinel and self-entity for iter_siblings.
- Recursive shallow helpers rewritten ITERATIVELY (SLA lattice forbids recursive futures under per-batch UseAfterMove rules): `root_ancestor` / `iter_ancestors_count` use bounded `while steps < 64` counters (only counter updates, no `buf = push(buf, x)` inside the loop). `iter_ancestors` accumulation expressed as a flat `b1..b9` short-return-on-no-parent push ladder. `iter_descendants` rewritten as a fully-unrolled DEPTH-2 DFS ladder (root children -> grandchildren interleave to produce shallow recursion's exact preorder: `child0, grandchild0, grandchild1, ..., child1, ...`).
- Tuple-return callsites replaced with wrapper structs (Batch 373 avoidance rule):
  EcsRqRelatedDeep { found, value } -- `related` accessors `found`/`value`.
  EcsRqParentDeep { found, value } -- `parent_of` accessors `found`/`value`.
  EcsRqStackPopDeep { ok, value, new_stack } -- `_pop` accessors `ok`/`value`/`new_stack`.
- `add_child` existing-slot branch rewritten as parallel-if cascade-of-return ladder: `if idx == k && r.cnt<k> == j { r.ch<k>_<j> = child; r.cnt<k> = j+1; return r; };` -- avoids the prior nested `if idx == k && r.cnt<k> < CAP` push-ladder form which the SA backend swallows.

Tests (10) -- `tests/test_ecs_lib_relationship_query_iter_deep_isolated.sla` (panic 141600-141697, distinct -- verified before doc). No tuple-return destructuring; no `let m = fn(m, ...)` chained rebinding; only sequential `t0/t1/.../b1/b2/...` and `let`-once field assigns. Both SA + default backends: 10/10 pass.

Post-batch counts (measured): 479 lib modules | 207 `*_deep.sla` modules | 383 test files | 207 `*_deep_isolated.sla` test files | 90 examples | 6735 `@test` total across lib+tests+examples.
Next free panic band: 141800+ (do not reuse -- Batch 378 used 141600-141697; scratch-band 150000-151719 used in /tmp/repro_*.sla scratch files does not appear in any test file).
Next batch candidates: relationship_methods_extras (RelatedDespawnResult / RecursiveTraverseResult / WithRelatedSpawnsResult -- deflated BFS over relationship tree -- iterative rewrite), hierarchy_commands (imports related facades), commands_relationship (large; subdivide), schedule_stepping (large), archetype_registry (imports world_registry -- couples registry world frame). Leave out: TaskPool/async/parallel; full reflect* core runtime (non-core reflection deepens OK).



## Batch 379 -- relationship_methods_extras_deep (DONE 2026-07-12)

Deep variant of `lib/relationship_methods_extras.sla` mirroring `src/relationship/related_methods.rs` pub fns (add_one_related / detach_all_related / add_descendant / despawn_related / despawn_children / with_related / with_related_entities / insert_recursive BFS / remove_recursive BFS / spawned_with_related scalar accessor) with cap-8/cap-4 parallel-array structured storage (no Vec, no recursion).

Storage:
- EcsRelExtrasDeep -- cap-8 related × cap-4 descendants-per-related: `entity_id` i64, `r0..r7` related i64, `r_count` i32, `d0_0..d0_3 .. d7_0..d7_3` descendants i64, `dc0..dc7` descendant-per-slot counts i32, `spawned_with_related` i32 tracking counter.
- EcsRelExtrasDespawnDeep { despawned_count: i32, first_despawned: i64 } — result of despawn_related / despawn_children; accessors despawn_count / despawn_first.
- EcsRelExtrasTraverseDeep { visited_count: i32, first_visited: i64 } — result of insert_recursive / remove_recursive BFS; accessors rec_count / rec_first.

Critical engineering notes:

- cascade-of-return pattern reused from Batch 377 (lib/table_mod_deep.sla `_ecs_tables_deep_set_table`) for add_one_related and add_descendant: `if idx == 0 { ...r0 = entity; r_count = 1; return r; }; ...; ` — keeps the new entity consumption single-move per branch and avoids SA UseAfterMove. The prior nested `if idx == k && r_count < CAP` push-ladder form is SWALLOWED by the SA backend (Batch 378 finding) so is not used here.
- `_ecs_rel_extras_deep_total_visits` uses a flat `let`-ladder accumulator (Batch 378 rule — no `mut` counter and no while-loop accumulation, since SA swallows field-assigns inside while bodies): `let c0 = r.r_count; let c1 = c0 + _dcount(r, 0); ...; let c8 = c7 + _dcount(r, 7); return c8;`.
- EcsRelExtrasSpawnsDeep was REMOVED as unused — there is no `with_related_spawns`-style API fn returning it; spawned tracking is exposed through the simple `spawned_with_related` i32 accessor on EcsRelExtrasDeep instead.
- struct-literal-in-tests caveat (Batch 379): SA rejects `let dz = EcsRelExtrasDespawnDeep { despawned_count: 0, first_despawned: -1 };` with a syntax error (`expected semicolon, found {`) at the `{` following the struct name. Tests rewritten to construct result structs via library function paths instead (e.g. `let dz = ecs_rel_extras_deep_despawn_related(r_empty, 0);`). Unused result structs removed from the library accordingly.

## Batch 380 -- hierarchy_commands_deep (DONE 2026-07-12)

Deep variant of `lib/hierarchy_commands.sla` mirroring `src/hierarchy.rs` `EntityCommands` / `EntityWorldMut` pub methods on `ChildOf` (add_child / insert_child / detach_child / detach_all_children / replace_children / replace_children_with_difference / despawn_children / despawn) with a self-contained cap-8 kind-discriminated deferred command queue + cap-8×cap-4 entity-list pool + cap-8 parent × cap-4 children world (no Vec, no recursion, no generic facade).

Storage:
- EcsHierCmdsDeep -- cap-8 command queue: kind k0..7 i32, target t0..7 i64, primary child c0..7 i64, insertion index i0..7 i32, list-indices u0..7 / r0..7 / n0..7 i32 (unrelate / relate / newly), count i32.
- EcsHierCmdStateDeep -- bundles EcsHierCmdsDeep queue + EcsHierListPoolDeep into one struct (SA by-value; both must update together so each push command returns the combined state).
- EcsHierListPoolDeep -- cap-8 lists × cap-4 entities: e0_0..e0_3 .. e7_0..e7_3 i64, per-list counts n0..7 i32, pool_count i32. push_slot / at / len helpers reference a list by index.
- EcsHierWorldDeep -- cap-8 parents × cap-4 children: par0..7 i64, ch0_0..ch7_3 i64, cnt0..7 i32, slot_count i32, alive0..7 i32 (alive bit per spawned entity 1..8), next_entity i64.
- EcsHierCmdApplyDeep { world, commands(state) } -- apply result; accessors ecs_hier_cmd_apply_world / ecs_hier_cmd_apply_commands (commands is the full state, queue reset to empty).
- EcsHierReserveDeep { world, commands(queue), entity } -- reserve_entity result; accessors reserve_world / reserve_commands / reserve_entity.

Critical engineering notes:

- apply RESETS the queue count to 0 on the returned state via `_ecs_hier_cmds_deep_state_cleared(s)` -- required so chained `apply` calls only run newly-queued commands (matches the shallow `RelationshipCommands.apply` returning an emptied inner queue). Without the reset, a chained apply re-ran the prior commands and detached/added duplicates, tripping the has_parent / child_count assertions. This is the Batch 380 finding companion to Batch 378's "SA swallows field-assigns inside if/while": top-level function-scope field-assign on the param IS legal on SA and persists (Batch 374), so `s.queue.count = 0; return s;` in the cleared-helper works.
- apply is a flat let-ladder over the 8 queue slots (w0..w7 + early-return-on-qcnt) -- no `while` loop (Batch 378 rule: SA swallows field-assigns inside while bodies; the world accumulator must be a flat rebinding ladder read off as the final one).
- `_ecs_hier_world_deep_diff_relate` DEDUPES -- skips already-present entities before add_child_into -- so `replace_diff` with an overlapping relate set (entity already a child of the parent) doesn't duplicate it. Mirrors Bevy `replace_related_with_difference` "ensure these are related" semantics. Without dedupe, the overlapping relate pushed the entity twice and child_count overshot by 1.
- `set_slot` / parent-slot add / insert / remove use field-assign on struct-by-value params (Batch 374/366 flat `if idx == N { ...; return q; };` form). insert_child fully-unrolled per-slot shift-right-then-drop (no nested if/else chains -- SA parse-safe). `remove_child_slot` shifts children down preserving order (no swap-remove tail-fill on the child list itself, matching shallow remove_related order semantics).
- Tuple-return callsites replaced with wrapper structs (Batch 373 avoidance rule): EcsHierCmdApplyDeep (apply) and EcsHierReserveDeep (reserve_entity) with scalar accessors -- no test destructuring. `ecs_hier_world_deep_spawn` returns a `(world, entity)` tuple consumed ONLY inside `ecs_hier_commands_deep_reserve_entity` (library-internal), never destructured in tests.
- `ecs_hier_cmds_deep_clear` alias added alongside the canonical `ecs_hier_commands_deep_clear` to name-match the `_cmds_deep_` form used by the push commands (test calls the alias name).

Tests (10) -- `tests/test_ecs_lib_hierarchy_commands_deep_isolated.sla` (panic 142000-142046, 47 codes, distinct -- verified with `rg -o "panic\(([0-9]+)\)" ... -r '$1' | sort -n | awk 'NR>1 && $1==prev {print "DUP:", $1}'` showing empty before documenting). No tuple-return destructuring; no `let m = fn(m, ...)` chained rebinding; only sequential `s0/s1/.../w1/w2/...` and `let`-once field assigns; no struct-literal-in-tests with non-trivial field init. Both SA + default backends: 10/10 pass.

Leave out: TaskPool/async/parallel; full reflect* core runtime (non-core reflection deepens OK).


## Batch 381 -- commands_relationship_deep (DONE 2026-07-12)

Deep variant of `lib/commands_relationship.sla` mirroring `src/system/commands/relationship.rs` + `relationship.sla` pub surface (set_related / add_related / insert_related / remove_related / detach_all_related / replace_related / replace_related_with_difference / despawn / despawn_related / reserve_entity / spawn_related / `RelationshipRelatedSpawnerCommands`) with a self-contained cap-8 kind-discriminated command queue + cap-8×cap-4 entity-list pool + cap-2 relationship-kind registry × cap-8 source→target adjacency (no Vec, no recursion in accumulators, no generic world).

Storage:
- EcsRelCmdsDeep -- cap-8 command queue: kind k0..7 i32, kind_id kid0..7 i32, target t0..7 i64, source s0..7 i64, index i0..7 i64, related_index r0..7 / unrelate_index u0..7 / newly_index n0..7 i32, count i32. Index default sentinel ECS_RELCMD_INDEX_MAX = 2147483647 ("append at tail").
- EcsRelCmdStateDeep -- bundles EcsRelCmdsDeep queue + EcsRelCmdListPoolDeep (SA by-value; both must update together).
- EcsRelCmdListPoolDeep -- cap-8 lists × cap-4 entities; same shape as Batch 380 pool.
- EcsRelCmdWorldDeep -- cap-2 relationship-kind registry (kind0/kind1 — each kind_id/link/one/reg flags) × cap-8 source→target adjacency (k0src0..k0src7 + k0tgt0..k0tgt7 + k0cnt; same for kind1) + alive0..8 (alive bit per spawned entity 1..9) + next_entity.
- Wrapper structs (Batch 373 rule -- no test tuple destructuring): EcsRelCmdApplyDeep { world, state } (apply; state has queue reset to 0 per Batch 380) accessors apply_world/apply_state/apply_commands; EcsRelCmdReserveDeep { world, state, entity } accessors reserve_world/reserve_state/reserve_entity; EcsRelCmdSpawnRelDeep { world, state, entity } accessors spawn_rel_world/spawn_rel_state/spawn_rel_entity; EcsRelSpawnerDeep { state, kind_id, target } builder + EcsRelSpawnerSpawnDeep { world, spawner, entity } accessors spawn_world/spawn_spawner/spawn_entity; EcsRelSpawnLinkedDeep { world, entity } accessors spawn_linked_world/spawn_linked_entity (for direct spawn_related); EcsRelCmdStoreListDeep { state, index } (library-internal store_entity_list result).

Critical engineering notes:

- KEY Batch 381 finding for one_to_one relationships: target_mode==ONE requires an OTHERS removal sweep -- before upserting the new (src, tgt), remove every OTHER source currently pointing at `tgt` -- mirror shallow `relationship_world_set_related_at`'s `RELATIONSHIP_TARGET_ONE` branch. Without it, setting a distinct source in a one-to-one kind appends instead of replacing the existing source, so `has_related(first)` stayed true after `set_related(second, target)` and `source_count` overshot. `_ecs_rel_cmd_world_deep_set_related` implements this via `_ecs_rel_cmd_dwdr_remove_others_for_target` (flat 8-pass remove-one-match ladder) + `_ecs_rel_cmd_world_deep_find_other_target_idx` (scans the 8 pair slots, excludes keep_src from removal). Re-resolves the src index after the sweep (it may have shifted).
- apply RESETS the queue count to 0 on the returned state via `_ecs_rel_cmd_state_cleared` (Batch 380 finding) so chained applies only run newly-queued commands -- matches shallow `relationship_commands_apply` returning a fresh empty RelationshipCommands. Without it, the replace_diff / remove_related chained applies re-ran prior commands.
- apply is a flat let-ladder over the 8 queue slots (w0..w7 + early-return-on-qcnt) -- no `while` loop (Batch 378 rule).
- `source_count` / `source_at` use RECURSIVE read-only scans (`_ecs_rel_cmd_count_sources_for_target` / `_ecs_rel_cmd_scan_target_for_pos`). Verified SA permits simple recursion for pure i32 returns: recfact probe `recfact(4)==24` passes. The "no recursion" cookbook guidance was about Constructors/UseAfterMove on cross-call accumulator chains; read-only i32 recursion is fine. `detach_all_related` still uses the flat 8-pass remove-one-match ladder (not recursion) because it mutates the world via field-assign during the scan.
- RegisterRedefinition dodge (Batch 373 Redeclaration rule): rename `let w = fn(w, ...)` chained rebinds in `_ecs_rel_cmd_world_deep_replace_related` / `_ecs_rel_cmd_world_deep_replace_diff` / `_ecs_rel_cmd_world_deep_despawn_related` to sequential `w0/w1/w2` names -- the SA backend's RegisterRedefinition trap fires on `let w = ...; let w = ...` over a struct-by-value param within one fn.
- REMOVE_RELATED target-guards: `_ecs_rel_diff_remove_one_with_target` only removes the source if its current target equals command.target (mirror shallow `relationship_commands_apply_remove` guarding on the current target being the given one).
- despawn_related with link_despawn=true marks the target AND every source pointing at it not-alive (`_ecs_rel_cmd_kill_src_if` flat ladder) via `_ecs_rel_cmd_despawn_sources_of` -- mirror shallow linked_despawn.
- `ecs_rel_cmd_world_deep_spawn` returns a `(world, entity)` tuple consumed ONLY inside `ecs_rel_cmds_deep_reserve_entity` / `ecs_rel_cmds_deep_spawn_related` / `ecs_rel_spawner_deep_spawn` (library-internal) -- never destructured in tests.

Tests (10) -- `tests/test_ecs_lib_commands_relationship_deep_isolated.sla` (panic 142100-142247, 53 codes, distinct -- verified with `rg -o "panic\(([0-9]+)\)" ... -r '$1' | sort -n | awk 'NR>1 && $1==prev {print "DUP:", $1}'` showing empty before documenting). No tuple-return destructuring; only `pair.0`/`pair.1` on the library-internal `ecs_rel_cmd_world_deep_spawn` tuple inside tests is NOT present (tests use the wrapper-struct scalar accessors instead). Both SA + default backends: 10/10 pass.

210 `*_deep_isolated.sla` test files | 90 examples | 6765 `@test` total across lib+tests+examples.

Next batch candidates: schedule_stepping (large ~1005 lines; subdivide into 2-3 batches -- stepping cursor + pending-exit + ignore flags), archetype_registry (274 lines, @import world_registry -- couples to registry world frame).

## Batch 382 -- schedule_stepping_deep (DONE 2026-07-12)

Deep variant of `lib/schedule_stepping.sla` mirroring `src/schedule/stepping.rs` `Stepping::next_frame` + `ScheduleState::skipped_systems` (Bevy src/schedule/stepping.rs lines 386-508 / 513-564 / 681-817). Self-contained cap-8 queued updates + cap-8 schedule_order + cap-8 per-schedule states (`EcsSteppingScheduleStateDeepS` cap-16 per-system behaviors b0..15 + cap-16 per-system pending behavior_updates u0..15) + cursor state. Mirrors shallow `lib/schedule_stepping.sla` lines 275-1005 (inline Vec-based deep) onto fixed-cap storage.

Wrapper structs (Batch 373 rule -- no test tuple destructuring):
- `EcsStepSchedulesDeep { valid, l0..l7, count }` -- `schedules()` result. Accessors `_schedules_valid_s` / `_schedules_count_s` / `_schedules_at_s(idx)`.
- `EcsStepCursorDeep { valid, label, system_idx }` -- `cursor()` result. Accessors `_cursor_valid_s` / `_cursor_label_s` / `_cursor_system_s`.
- `EcsStepSkippedDeep { valid, skip_count, next_system, f0..f15 }` -- `skipped_systems()` payload. Accessors `_skipped_valid_s` / `_skipped_count_s` / `_skipped_next_s` / `_skipped_at_s(idx)` (returns bool).
- `EcsSteppingDeepSkippedResultDeep { d, skipped }` -- bundles post-traversal `d` + the `EcsStepSkippedDeep`. Accessors `_skipped_result_d_s` / `_skipped_result_skipped_s`.
- `EcsStepSkipAccDeep { is_cursor, pos, start, local_action, cursor_sys, next_sys, skip_count, f0..f15 }` -- INTERNAL ONLY accumulator threaded through the recursive walker.
- `EcsSteppingNextFrameApplyDeep { d, flag }` -- INTERNAL ONLY threads `mut_reset_cursor` (i32) across the flat 8-slot apply ladder.

Public API surface:
- `ecs_stepping_deep_new_s() -> EcsSteppingDeepS`.
- `ecs_stepping_deep_enable_s` / `_disable_s` / `_step_frame_s` / `_continue_frame_s` -- queue SET_ACTION updates (Waiting / RunAll / Step / Continue).
- `ecs_stepping_deep_queue_set_action_s` / `_queue_add_schedule_s` / `_queue_remove_schedule_s` / `_queue_clear_schedule_s` / `_queue_set_behavior_s` / `_queue_clear_behavior_s` -- low-level queue setters (cap-8 reject silent).
- `ecs_stepping_deep_next_frame_s` / `ecs_stepping_deep_begin_frame_s` -- apply queued updates.
- `ecs_stepping_deep_schedules_s` / `_cursor_s` / `_skipped_systems_s(d, label, system_count)` -- the three Bevy public surface fns.
- `ecs_stepping_deep_is_enabled_s` / `_action_s` / `_update_count_s` / `_state_exists_s` / `_has_schedule_s` / `_behavior_for_s(label, system_index)`.

Critical engineering notes:

- KEY Batch 382 finding: SA permits SIMPLE RECURSION that RETURNS A STRUCT as long as accumulator field-writes go through cascade-of-return helpers at top-level function scope (Batch 377 shape) and never inside `if`/`while` (Batch 378 rule). `_ecs_stepping_deep_step_skip_walk` is the first verified struct-returning recursive walker: each level returns the new `EcsStepSkipAccDeep` after invoking cascade-of-return helpers `_skip_acc_set_skipcounty`/etc + arithmetic helpers `_step_skip_flag`/`_step_skip_la`/`_step_skip_pos` (Batch 381 simple-i32 recursion pattern extended to struct-by-value returns). The prior "no recursion" cookbook guidance was about UseAfterMove on cross-call accumulator chains or i32 rebinds inside `if`/`while`; neither applies here (cursor walker has no `if`/`while` in its body at all, just top-level let-ladder + return-cascade).
- next_frame apply is a flat 8-slot let-ladder (`a0..a8` covers slots 0..7), no `while` per Batch 378 rule. Reset_cursor (Bevy bool) threads as `EcsSteppingNextFrameApplyDeep.flag` i32 because SA swallows `let mut x; if cond { x = 1; };` rebinds (Batch 373 rule). Reset_cursor applies when SET_ACTION target=RunAll OR after REMOVE_SCHEDULE (matches Bevy). Apply returns the state with `update_count = 0` so chained next_frame calls only run newly-queued commands (Batch 380 finding repeated).
- The walker dispatches on `(action, behavior)` via three pure-i32 helpers mirroring Bevy 727-751 match cases: `_step_skip_flag` returns the skip bit; `_step_skip_pos` applies the per-branch `pos += 1`; `_step_skip_la` mutates the running local_action (Step->Waiting on `i==pos`; Continue+Break->Waiting when `i>start`). The tail rule `_step_skip_tail_pos` adds the Bevy trailing `if i == pos && action != Waiting { pos += 1 }`.
- `_ecs_stepping_deep_state_apply_updates_s` drains pending behavior_updates recursively over cap-16 slots. `_drain_apply_s` treats `upd == -1` as a CLEAR (reset to Continue via `clear_behavior_s`) and `upd >= 0` as a SET (via `set_behavior_s`). The initial draft incorrectly treated `upd < 0` as a "no-op skip" -- fixed after a clear_behavior-after-NEVER_RUN test showed `b5` staying NEVER_RUN after the clear drain.
- `behavior_for_s` out-of-range returns Continue default (`system_index < 0 OR >= ECS_STEP_CAP_SYSTEMS OR >= node_count`). Mirrors `behaviors.get(&NodeId).unwrap_or(&SystemBehavior::Continue)`; brackets the raw per-slot accessor so behaviors past the live node_count are reported as unset/Continue.
- `_state_resize_s` grows node_count up to cap-16 (mirror Bevy node_ids clone-from schedule). `set_behavior_s` auto-grows node_count via `_state_grow_s` so behavior set on a high system_index keeps node_count in sync.
- Fix-on-iterate: the initial draft had a slot 0 SKIPPING bug in next_frame's flat ladder (the ladder covered slots 1..7 via `a1..a7` against the post-prelude d, never slot 0); isolated `ecs_stepping_deep_enable_s + next_frame_s` probe caught it (`action` stayed RunAll after enable), and the ladder was rewritten as `a0 = apply_result_new(d1, 0)` then `a1..a8 = apply_slot(a_{prev}, 0..7, d1)`. removed `_ecs_stepping_deep_next_frame_step` no-op scaffold in the final patch.
- `_ecs_stepping_deep_insert_order_at` + `_insert_shift` cap-8 compact right-shift insert (mirror Bevy `schedule_order.insert(pos, label)` when skipped_systems encounters a new label). `_ecs_stepping_deep_remove_from_order_scan` recursive only (never mutates d mid-scan: each step builds a new d via `_set_so_at` and threads forward).

Tests (10) -- `tests/test_ecs_lib_schedule_stepping_deep_isolated.sla` (panic 142300-142399, 80 codes, distinct -- verified with `rg -o "panic\(([0-9]+)\)" <file> --no-filename -r '$1' | sort -n | awk 'NR>1 && $1==prev {print "DUP:", $1; exit}'` showing empty before documenting). No tuple-return destructuring. Cover:
1. new + actions + enable/disable/step/continue queueing + update_count + payload slot reads.
2. next_frame apply add/remove/clear schedule + has_schedule + update_count reset.
3. set_behavior enqueues-pending; behavior_for before drain is still Continue; first skipped_systems drains the pending and behavior_for after drain matches the requested Break.
4. clear_behavior resets request -- node stays NEVER_RUN after apply (queued) until the next skipped_systems drains the queued clear into Continue.
5. cursor() not-found on RunAll; after enable+skipped_systems populates node_count, cursor() valid.
6. schedules() invalid until initialized; valid + order copy + scheduled mismatch (remove compacts).
7. skipped_systems Waiting walk over 4 Continue systems -- all skipped, skip_count=4, next_sys=0.
8. skipped_systems Step walk -- cursor steps system 0, action Step->Waiting, skip_count=3, cursor advances to 1.
9. skipped_systems Continue + Break breakpoint -- Break at system 2 halts after the cursor advances through 0->1 and stops at 2; skip=[0,0,1,1]; action stays Continue.
10. cap-8 queued-update reject (8-updates cap fills when enable + 7 add_schedule fired) + cap-16 set_behavior growth + cap-16 reject at system_index=16 + behavior_for out-of-range Continue + begin_frame = next_frame identity.

Both SA + default backends: 10/10 pass.

## Batch 383 -- archetype_registry_deep (DONE 2026-07-12)

Deep variant of `lib/archetype_registry.sla` mirroring its `registry_archetype_world_*` pub surface on a self-contained cap-8 archetypes x cap-16 entities-per-arch x cap-8 component-ids-per-arch world. Unlike the shallow file (`@import "world_registry.sla"`), the deep inlines the entity-generation / alive-bit / per-entity component-attach registry so the deep does NOT couple to the world frame (per the Batch 382 plan note). Mirrors Bevy `src/archetype.rs` `Archetype` + entity-archetype location mapping.

Wrapper structs (Batch 373 rule -- no test tuple destructuring):
- `EcsArchInfoDeep { id, storage }` -- `register_table` / `register_sparse_set` info-only return. Accessors `_info_id` / `_info_storage`.
- `EcsArchRegisterDeep { world, info }` -- the `_w`-suffix world-carrying variants `register_table_w` / `register_sparse_set_w`. Accessors `_register_world` / `_register_info`.
- `EcsArchSpawnDeep { world, entity }` -- spawn. Accessors `_spawn_world` / `_spawn_entity`.
- `EcsArchSlotDeep { world, archetype_id }` -- `get_or_create_archetype`. Accessors `_slot_world` / `_slot_id`.
- `EcsArchSignDeep { c0..c7, count }` -- entity component signature. Accessors `_sign_count` / `_sign_at`.
- `EcsArchQueryDeep { found, count, e0..e15, g0..g15 }` -- `query_component`. Accessors `_query_found` / `_query_count` / `_query_entity_id` / `_query_generation`.
- `EcsArchQueryAcc` library-internal walk accumulator.

Storage:
- `EcsArchArchDeep` -- cap-8 component-id slots (c0..c7 + comp_count) + cap-16 entity-id slots (e0..e15 + ent_count).
- `EcsArchLocationDeep` -- per-entity record (entity_id, archetype_id, row). Cap-16 location table inlined into `EcsArchWorldDeep`.
- `EcsArchWorldDeep` -- cap-8 archetypes (a0..a7) + cap-16 locations (loc0..loc15) + cap-16 generations (g0..g15) + cap-16 alive bits (alive0..alive15) + cap-16 per-entity attach bitwords (attach0..attach15) + cap-8 component storage tags (comp0..comp7) + comp_count + next_entity.

Critical engineering notes:

- Self-contained registry: `@import "world_registry.sla"` (the shallow's coupling) is avoided by inlining cap-16 generations, cap-16 alive-bits, and cap-16 per-entity component-attach bitwords (cap-8 components packed as i32 bitmask using `_bits_set`/`_bits_has`/`_bits_clear` 8-case helpers, bitmask constants 1/2/4/8/16/32/64/128, signed-NOT clear masks -2/-3/-5/-9/-17/-33/-65/-129).
- `_signature_for_entity` uses a flat 8-step let-ladder over cid 0..7 via `_ecs_arch_world_deep_sign_step` helper (Batch 378 rule -- no `while`, no `let mut`). Since the scan walks cid ascending, the signature stays sorted -- matches shallow's `registry_world_has_component` (which walks `registry.columns` ascending by `component_id`).
- find_archetype uses RECURSIVE read-only scan over cap-8 archetype slots (`_ecs_arch_world_deep_find_scan` -- Batch 381 finding: pure i32 recursion OK). Signature-matching uses flat 8-slot early-out comparison via `_ecs_arch_eq_slot`.
- get_or_create_archetype: existing match -> existing slot id; otherwise insert into the next free slot (cap-8 reject silent -> returns archetype_id=-1). Signature copy uses RECURSIVE `_ecs_arch_world_deep_arch_copy_signature` over sig.count steps with cascade-of-return `_set_component_at` + tail-set `comp_count`.
- detach: swap-remove from the archetype's `entity_ids` list. When row != last, copy `eids[last]` into `eids[row]` and update `loc[moved].row = row`. Drawn as a same-row bool threaded via `_ecs_arch_world_deep_detach_swap_in` early-return-on-equal helper (`if same_row { return w0; }`) -- flat instead of `if cond { w = fn(w, x); }` (SA-swallow bug -- Batch 378 finding).
- query_component: RECURSIVE `_ecs_arch_query_walk_archetype` (cap-8 archetype slot recursion) + nested RECURSIVE `_ecs_arch_query_walk_row` (cap-16 row recursion within each matching archetype). Both pushed via `_ecs_arch_query_push` cascade-of-return set-pair helper into `EcsArchQueryAcc`; finalized via `_ecs_arch_query_acc_finalize` into `EcsArchQueryDeep`. cap-16 reject silent when accumulator is full. Query results carry (eid, generation) pairs captured at query time.
- KEY Batch 383 finding (extends Batch 382): SA permits struct-returning recursive walkers with valid struct-by-value accumulator forwarding as long as accumulator field-assigns use cascade-of-return helpers at top-level function scope (Batch 377 shape). This batch verifies the pattern continues to hold with FOUR independent recursive helpers: `_ecs_arch_world_deep_find_scan`, `_ecs_arch_world_deep_arch_copy_signature`, `_ecs_arch_query_walk_archetype`, `_ecs_arch_query_walk_row`. The accumulated per-arch push happens via cascade-of-return set-pair helpers, never via `if cond { acc.field = ...; }` (the SA-swallow bug from Batch 378).
- Register returned BOTH info AND world: initial draft had `ecs_arch_world_deep_register_table` return only `EcsArchInfoDeep` which made test-side chained register calls hard. Added `_w` suffix variants `ecs_arch_world_deep_register_table_w` / `ecs_arch_world_deep_register_sparse_set_w` that return `EcsArchRegisterDeep { world, info }`. The unsuffixed variants remain for surface-symmetry with shallow `registry_archetype_world_register_table` literal return shape.
- Insert/remove/despawn apply immediately (no deferred queue) -- the "apply RESETS queue" convention (Batch 380 finding) is N/A here.

## Batch 384 — hierarchy_relationship_adapter_deep (DONE 2026-07-12)

`lib/hierarchy_relationship_adapter_deep.sla` (1087 lines) mirrors shallow `lib/hierarchy_relationship_adapter.sla` (the typed ChildOf facade that delegates to `relationship_world_*`) as a SELF-CONTAINED cap-16 entity registry + singly-linked-sibling ChildOf relation. NO `@import relationship.sla` -- the per-entity parent/head/next/gen/alive arrays are all inlined.

Storage: `EcsHierWorldDeep` holds cap-16 `parent0..15` (parent id per entity, -1 = root), cap-16 `head0..15` (first child id per entity), cap-16 `next0..15` (next sibling id per entity -- singly-linked sibling list), cap-16 `gen0..15`, cap-16 `alive0..15` (alive bit), and `next_entity`. Children of a parent form a singly-linked list rooted at `head[parent]` linked via `next[child]`.

Public surface: EcsHierEntityDeep { id, generation } + `ecs_hier_entity_eq_deep` / `ecs_hier_entity_id_deep` / `ecs_hier_entity_gen_deep` / `ecs_hier_entity_new(id, gen)` (public ctor for tests); EcsHierSpawnDeep { world, entity } + `_world`/`_entity` accessors for `ecs_hier_world_deep_spawn`; EcsHierSpawnChildDeep { world, child } + `_world`/`_entity` accessors for `ecs_hier_world_deep_spawn_child`; spawn_world/is_alive; add_child/insert_child (doubly-detached reparent: removes child from its old parent's sibling list, then inserts at an index into the new parent's child-list); has_parent/parent/child_count/child_at; children() returns EcsHierChildrenDeep { count, e0..e15 } with `_count`/`_at` accessors; ancestors/root_ancestor/descendants (BFS)/descendants_depth_first (DFS pre-order)/siblings/leaves all return EcsHierQueryDeep { count, e0..e15 } via `_query_deep_count`/`_query_deep_at`; detach_child (no-op if actual parent differs) / detach_all_children; replace_children; replace_children_with_difference (via EcsHierDiffListDeep { count, e0..e7 } builder + `_count`/`_at`/`_push`); despawn_children (recursive kill of all descendants) + despawn (entity + its descendants).

Helpers: per-entity field accessors `_ecs_hier_world_deep_parent_at/_set_parent`, `_head_at/_set_head`, `_next_at/_set_next`, `_generation_at/_set_generation`, `_alive_at/_set_alive` (16-case cascade-of-return). Spawn-related `_ecs_hier_spawn_wrap`. `_ecs_hier_world_deep_add_child` reads old_parent, removes child from old parent's head-list via `_ecs_hier_remove_from_old_parent`/`_ecs_hier_remove_from_list_walk` (recursive read-only splice prev.next=target.next), then appends to the new parent's child-list tail via `_ecs_hier_append_child_tail`/`_ecs_hier_append_child_tail_walk` (recursive), then sets parent[child]=parent. `insert_child` walks with a recursive index counter. `child_count` uses RECURSIVE `_ecs_hier_count_walk_world` (world-carrying read-only counter). ancestors/root_ancestor walk up `parent[]` chain. descendants BFS uses `EcsHierBfsAccDeep` + `_ecs_hier_bfs_step`/`_ecs_hier_extend_queue_with_children`/`_ecs_hier_extend_queue_walk`. DFS uses `EcsHierDfsAccDeep` + `_ecs_hier_dfs_push_children`/`_ecs_hier_dfs_walk_children` (pre-order recursion). siblings via `_ecs_hier_siblings_walk` (recurse the sibling list of the parent, skip self). leaves = DFS descendants filtered by `head[ent] < 0`. despawn_children + despawn use `_ecs_hier_kill_children_rec` and `_ecs_hier_kill_entity` (clear head/next/parent, bump gen, alive=0, writes AFTER recursion for recursion-safety).

KEY Batch 384 finding #1: initial `_ecs_hier_kill_children_rec(w0, cur)` only recursed into `head[cur]` (first child's subtree) then killed `cur`, but never continued down the SIBLING list (`next[cur]`). The fix: `return _ecs_hier_kill_children_rec(w2, nxt);` after the kill, so the recursion walks the entire sibling list of `parent`'s children -- otherwise despawn_children/despawn only killed the FIRST child and its subtree, leaving subsequent siblings (and their subtrees, including grandchildren) alive. Caught by SA `EcsHierWorldDeep despawn_children recursive kill + grandchildren` (panic 142583, g2 alive when it should be dead) and `replace_children_with_difference + linked despawn` (panic 142546, child3 alive when it should be dead). Both backends caught it on the first SA run after the lib was originally built.

KEY Batch 384 finding #2: SA rejects `EcsHierEntityDeep { id: -1, generation: 0 }` struct-literal construction IN TESTS (the Batch 379 rule extends to arbitrary entity wrappers too -- `error: found '{' expected semicolon`). Fix: expose a public `ecs_hier_entity_new(id, generation)` constructor on the lib so tests probe out-of-range (-1) and stale-generation (id 0 gen 5) non-alive entities via a library function path.

The cap-16 entity cap: spawn rejects silently (returns entity id -1) when `next_entity >= ECS_HIER_CAP_ENTITIES` (16). Tests must spawn 16 entities to get ids 0..15 (16 spawns, the 16th is id 15) and a 17th spawn to trigger reject -- the cap test spine must label those spawns carefully or the off-by-one assert panics (caught: initial draft asserted the 15th spawn's id == 15 when it's the 16th spawn that owns id 15).

Tests (10) -- `tests/test_ecs_lib_hierarchy_relationship_adapter_deep_isolated.sla` (panic 142500-142599, 97 codes, distinct -- verified with `rg -o "panic\(([0-9]+)\)" <file> -r '$1' | sort -n | awk 'NR>1 && $1==prev {print "DUP:", $1}'` showing empty before documenting). No tuple-return destructuring; all return wrappers consumed via `_world`/`_entity`/`_count`/`_at` accessors. Cover: new + spawn + spawn_entity + is_alive (out-of-range + stale gen probes via `ecs_hier_entity_new`); spawn_child + child_count + parent + child_at + has_parent (mirrors shallow "syncs childof and children"); add_child reparent decrement old/increment new + insert_child index 0 + detach_child (mirrors shallow "reparent insert and detach"); insert_child middle (idx 1) and tail (idx 4) + detach_child wrong-parent no-op; replace_children_with_difference + linked despawn + unrelate'd child stays alive (mirrors shallow "difference replace and linked despawn"); ancestors/root_ancestor (incl. root self) + BFS descendants + DFS pre-order descendants + siblings + leaves (mirrors shallow "traversal helpers", tree root->c1,c2; c1->g1,g2; c2->g3); children() wrapper + detach_all + re-add in reverse; despawn_children cascades to grandchildren + parent stays alive; despawn entity cascades to its descendants + siblings stay alive + parent still has remaining sibling; cap-16 silent reject on 17th spawn + diff list empty/push/at sanity.

Both SA + default backends: 10/10 pass.

Post-batch counts (measured): 485 lib modules | 213 `*_deep.sla` modules | 389 test files |
213 `*_deep_isolated.sla` test files | 90 examples | 6795 `@test` total across lib+tests+examples.
Next free panic band: 142600+ (Batch 384 used 142500-142599).
Next batch candidates: world_registry_erased (shallow @import world_registry -- needs self-contained world-frame variant, the Batch 383 archetype_registry pattern), system_param_table_erased / world_table_erased (registry-/table-erased coupled -- subdivide). Leave out: TaskPool/async/parallel; full reflect* core runtime (non-core reflection deepens OK).


## Batch 385 — world_registry_erased_deep (DONE 2026-07-12)

`lib/world_registry_erased_deep.sla` (1441 lines) mirrors shallow `lib/world_registry_erased.sla`'s
`RegistryErasedWorld<R, M>` registry world as a SELF-CONTAINED fixed-cap variant (NO `@import` --
the registry/column storage, resource slot, message slot, and typed (pos/vel/marker) component
columns are all inlined). The shallow uses generics `<R, M>` heavily and `@import`s five files
(world_registry, resource, messages, query_dynamic, box_drop, sa_std/core/box); the deep reifies that
erased "any concrete type" surface as three concrete typed columns keyed by `type_id`
(`ECS_REG_TYPE_POS=101` / `ECS_REG_TYPE_VEL=102` / `ECS_REG_TYPE_MARKER=103`), matching the two
shallow `@test`s which exercise only these three types plus the `ErasedTestTime` resource +
`ErasedTestEvent` message.

Storage: `EcsRegWorldDeep` with cap-16 entities (`gen0..15` + `alive0..15`, monotone `next_entity`,
`entity_count`) and cap-8 component columns (`comp_id`, `type_id`, `storage`, per-column `present`
i32 bitmask over cap-16 entities, per-column per-entity `added`/`changed` tick structs of kind
`EcsRegColTickE { t0..t15 }`). Typed storage lives in three parallel cap-8 column structs
(`EcsRegColDeepPos { x0..15, y0..15 }`, `EcsRegColDeepVel` same shape, `EcsRegColDeepMarker { v0..15 }`)
keyed into the world via cascade-of-return set helpers `_set_pos_col`/`_set_vel_col`/`_set_marker_col`.
The world has a single `change_tick`, one resource slot (`res_time_tick` + `res_time_set`) for
`EcsRegTimeDeep`, and one message slot (`msg_event_amount` + `msg_count`) for `EcsRegEventDeep`.

Public surface: `ecs_reg_entity_new(id, gen)` / `_eq_deep` / `_id_deep` / `_gen_deep`;
`ecs_reg_world_deep_new`/`_component_count`/`_entity_count`/`_change_tick`;

the Batch 373 wrapper with `_world_deep`/`_info_deep` accessors matching Batch 383's `_w`-suffix pattern);
`ecs_reg_register_info_deep` -> `EcsRegCompInfoDeep` + `_id_deep`; `ecs_reg_world_deep_spawn`/`_spawn_many`

`_query_changed` (return `EcsRegQueryDeep { count, e0..15 }` via `_count`/`_at` accessors);
`ecs_reg_world_deep_query_pair_pos_vel`/`_pair_without` (return `EcsRegPairQueryDeepPosVel { count, p0..15 }`

`ecs_reg_world_deep_query_pair_mut_pos_vel` (return `EcsRegPairMutDeepPosVel` + `_entity`/`_first`/`_second`/
`_first_comp_id`); `ecs_reg_world_deep_pair_write_first_pos_vel` (writes the new pos value via insert_pos);
`ecs_reg_world_deep_insert_resource`/`_get_resource` (single `EcsRegTimeDeep` slot +
`ecs_reg_time_deep_tick`); `ecs_reg_world_deep_write_message`/`_read_message` (single `EcsRegEventDeep`
slot with a monotone `msg_count`; `EcsRegMessageReadDeep { amount, count }` mirrors the shallow
`MessageRead<M>`); `ecs_reg_world_deep_register_many`/`_spawn_many` (recursive bulk-register/spawn
helpers used by the cap-reject tests to keep the test source small).

Per-typed-column scalars are also exposed: `EcsRegPosDeep`/`EcsRegVelDeep`/`EcsRegMarkerDeep`/
`EcsRegTimeDeep`/`EcsRegEventDeep` with `_new`/`_x`/`_y`/`_value`/`_tick`/`_amount` accessors, so tests
construct concrete typed values via library function paths (no struct-literal construction in tests,
per Batch 379 rule).

KEY Batch 385 finding #1: SA's codegen backend rejects a top-level `const ECS_REG_TICK_NONE: i32 = -1`
with a `CodegenError.CodegenError` raised inside `emitTopLevelConstDecl` -- SA cannot emit negative
literal constants at top-level scope. Replaced with `ECS_REG_TICK_NONE: i32 = 999999` (a positive
sentinel far above any valid tick we'd ever compare against). Caught only at `sa sla test` time,
not at `sa sla check`; check passes but `test`'s codegen fails.

KEY Batch 385 finding #2: extending Batch 378's SA-swallow bug for field-assign inside `if cond
{ w = fn(w, x); };` -- the same swallow applies to `let w1 = fn(w, x); return fn2(w1, ...)` chains
INSIDE an if-guard when the if-guard wraps the body's first write. The initial
`_ecs_reg_world_deep_insert_set_tick` used a single function whose `if was_present != true { let
w1 = _set_added(...); return _set_changed(w1, ...); }` branch + bare tail fell into the swallow, so
re-inserts ALSO updated `added_tick` (the test 8 `replace bumps changed but not added` probe caught
this). Fix: split into two distinct top-scope entrypoints `_set_added_and_changed` (first-insert) and
`_set_changed_only` (re-insert) and dispatch in the public `_insert_set_tick` via
`if was_present != true { return _set_added_and_changed(...); }; return _set_changed_only(...);`. The
cascade-of-return helper pattern holds across the split entrypoints.

KEY Batch 385 finding #3: file-size scaling. The default backend is orders-of-magnitude slower than
SA when a per-batch lib exceeds ~55K bytes (Batch 384's hierarchy lib was 55K; this lib is 73K because
of the cap-8 typed-column cascade-of-return boilerplate). Initial `sa sla test` default-backend
run was reported by SA test frame as `FileTooBig` until `spawn_many`/`register_many` recursive
helpers were added to shrink the cap-16 reject test source from 93 lines of explicit spawn/register
let-ladders to ~18 lines of helper calls. After the helper additions the default backend successfully
runs (149s on this lib, vs 4.7s on SA). Conventional cookbook gotcha: for any deep lib whose typed
storage requires many cascade-of-return helpers, prefer recursive bulk-load helpers in the test
layer to avoid the slow default-backend scaling.

Tick semantics tedious gotcha: the initial draft of test 8 used `query_changed_since(t_before_replace)`
where `t_before_replace = change_tick(w4)` -- the post-increment tick, which equals the re-insert
write tick, so `changed > since_tick` is always false for the just-written entity. Mirror the shallow
test 2 framing instead: insert-stamp ticks match `change_tick` AT INSERT (the shallow's
`registry_world_insert_component` writes `world.change_tick` without first bumping), so
`query_changed_since` must use a tick strictly less than the write tick. Conventional fix:
pick `since_tick` to be the change_tick of the world BEFORE the last mutation, not after.

## Batch 386 — world_table_value_deep (DONE 2026-07-12)

`lib/world_table_value_deep.sla` (1351 lines) mirrors shallow `lib/world_table_value.sla`'s
`TableValueWorld<T,R,M>` as a SELF-CONTAINED fixed-cap archetype-table variant (NO `@import` -- the
archetype storage, entity->(arch_id,row) location map, component tick tracking, resource slot, and
message slot are all inlined). The shallow uses generics `<T,R,M>` and `@import`s five files
(world_table, resource, messages, query_dynamic, box_drop); the deep reifies that surface on
fixed-cap storage with cap-4 archetypes x cap-4 component-cols/arch x cap-4 rows/arch x cap-8
entities, mirroring Bevy src/world/mod.rs `World` archetype-grouped storage + (arch_id,row) entity
location. Concrete typed plugs: `EcsTVDataDeep{amount}` (TableValueData), `EcsTVTimeDeep{tick}`
(TableValueTime resource), `EcsTVEventDeep{amount}` (TableValueEvent message). Wrapper structs
(EcsTVRegisterDeep/EcsTVSpawnDeep/EcsTVCompInfoDeep/EcsTVQueryDeep/EcsTVPairQueryMutDeep/EcsTVMessageReadDeep)
expose scalar accessors per the Batch 373 rule (NO tuple-return destructuring in tests;
`_world`/`_entity`/`_count`/`_at`/`_info_id`/`_pair`-helpers/--accessor convention). Public surface
mirrors shallow: `register_table`/`register_sparse_set`; `spawn`/`is_alive`;
`entity_archetype_id`/`entity_row`/`archetype_entity_count`; `has`/`get`; `insert` (replace-in-place
if comp already present, else migrate); `remove` (migrate to smaller arch incl. back to arch 0
empty); `despawn`; `increment_tick`; `query`/`query_with`/`query_without`/`query_added`/`query_changed`;
`query_pair_mut_first` + `pair_write_first`; `query_mut`/`write`; `insert_resource`/`get_resource`/
`resource_added_since`/`resource_changed_since`; `write_message`/`read_message`. The resource slot
has per-tick added/changed tracking matching the component pattern: first insert sets added+changed;
replace preserves added and bumps changed (the dual-entrypoint shape from Batch 385). The arch
migration on insert/remove: `_ecs_tv_arch_collect_sig` recursively collects the entity's current
arch's (comp_id, val, added, changed) signature; `_ecs_tv_build_insert_sig`/`_ecs_tv_build_remove_sig`
produce the target signature; `_ecs_tv_find_arch_for_sig` does exact-set-equality match across cap-4
archetypes; `_ecs_tv_create_arch_for_sig` allocates a new archetype (or returns -1 when capped);
`_ecs_tv_attach_row` writes the sig into a fresh row in the target arch; `_ecs_tv_detach_row`
swap-removes the departed row (copies the last row's content into the departed row + bumps the moved
entity's `loc_row`).

Tests (10) -- `tests/test_ecs_lib_world_table_value_deep_isolated.sla` (380 lines after final
patches, panic 142700-142834, 35 distinct codes verified unique with the standard `rg | sort -n |
awk` check). Cover: new + register table/sparse + spawn + change_tick increment-per-register;

returns entity to arch 0 (empty archetype); pair_mut writeback across multiple entities;
cap-4 arch silent reject on insert + cap-4 column cap silent reject on register.

Both SA + default backends: 10/10 pass. SA: 4.7s; default: ~25.7s. The lib is 70K bytes; the default
backend did NOT hit the FileTooBig error here (unlike Batch 385's 73K lib) because the recursive bulk
helper `_ecs_tv_spawn_n(w0, count)` defined INSIDE the test file (not the lib -- fine per the rules)
compresses the cap-4 spawn-reject sequence so the per-test `.test.sa` transcription stays bounded.

KEY Batch 386 finding #1 (CRITICAL, supersedes Batch 385's tick gotcha): SA passes structs by
reference / alias-by-value, NOT by-value-independently. After `let w3 = fn(w2)` mutates w2's fields in
place, `let x = change_tick(w2)` reads the POST-MUTATION value. The deep's `increment_tick`,
`register`, `insert`, `insert_resource` all mutate the world parameter's fields directly (`w0.field =
...`); the returned copy is aliased to the same mutated struct. The bug pattern: capture
`tick = change_tick(world_after_some_op)` for use as a `since_tick` query parameter, then call another
mutation; since the captured `tick` was the world's field (read through change_tick accessor), LATER
mutations retroactively re-write its meaning IF the test re-reads the same accessor from the aliased
variable. Concretely: Test 7's `t_after_insert = change_tick(w2); w3 = increment_tick(w2)";
second_insert_resource(w3)...` -- reading `change_tick(w2)` AFTER increment_tick mutates w2's
change_tick returns the bumped value, making the upcoming `resource_changed_since(t_after_insert)`
check `3 > 3 == false` and the test panics. The fix: compute `t_after_insert = before + 1`
arithmetically from an EARLIER pre-mutation capture, OR capture the value at the latest point
strictly BEFORE any mutation to the relevant field aliases the value. This affects Test 5 too:
`t_before_replace = change_tick(w8)` (read AFTER the increment that produced w8) returns the
post-increment tick, making `query_changed(since=t_before_replace)` empty even though a
replace-bumped-changed entity exists. The fix there is to capture `before_replace = change_tick(w7)`
BEFORE the increment and use that as `since_tick`. **Lesson: for any `since_tick` parameter, capture
the tick from a world binding that has NOT had a subsequent mutating call applied to it (whether to
the same name or to an alias of the same struct). When in doubt, derive the expected tick
arithmetically instead of re-reading it from the world.**

KEY Batch 386 finding #2 (cap semantics in test design): the deep's effective entity-spawn cap is
`ECS_TV_CAP_ROWS_PER_ARCH` (=4) for the empty archetype 0, NOT `ECS_TV_CAP_ENTITIES` (=8), because
freshly-spawned entities start in arch 0 and stay there unless they later gain a component that
migrates them out. An initial test draft tried to demonstrate an 8-entity-cap by spawning 7 entities
after a despawn and expecting `entity_count == 7`, but after exactly 4 spawns arch 0 is full
(`a0.row_count >= ECS_TV_CAP_ROWS_PER_ARCH`) and the 5th spawn silently returns `entity.id = -1`. The
correct cap-demonstration: spawn 4 (fill arch 0), verify `entity_count == 4`, then assert the 5th
spawn returns `entity.id == -1`. Note the prior Batch 385 lib's analogous cap test used
`ECS_REG_CAP_PER_INSERT_ENTITY` (=16) which DID match `ECS_REG_CAP_ENTITIES` (=16) -- the cap mismatch
specific to Batch 386 comes from arch-0-row-cap being the binding constraint for fresh spawns.

KEY Batch 386 finding #3 (archetype cap clamp on insert): `ECS_TV_CAP_ARCH = 4` means the world can
hold at most 4 archetypes total (arch 0 empty + 3 distinct-component-set archetypes). Inserting the
4th distinct component, e.g. inserting c3 when e1 already has {c0,c1,c2} in arch 3, asks
`_ecs_tv_create_arch_for_sig` for a 5th arch; the helper returns `(w1, -1)` (arch_count >= cap) and
the insert silently no-ops (e1 stays in arch 3, never gains c3). The test must therefore check
`archetype_count == 4` (NOT 5) and `has(e1, c3) == false` after the rejected insert (rather than
asserting 5 archetypes and reading c3's value back). The cap-4 column cap (test 10's first half)
shows the analogous silent reject on the 5th `register_table` call (returns
`CompInfoDeep.id == -1` and leaves `component_count == 4`), exactly mirroring Batch 385's cap shape.

KEY Batch 386 finding #4 (test-expectation alignment with archetype-rows): in Test 2 the diagonally
mirrored recipe (e1 inserted first, e2 second, both converging to {health,mana} arch) lands e1 at
row 0 and e2 at row 1 (`row_e2_before == 1`, NOT 0) -- the test originally mis-stated the expected
row as 0. (Appendix: after also inserting selected INTO e1, e1 migrates away from the {health,mana}
arch and the detachment's swap-removal brings e2 down to row 0, matching the shallow's downstream
assertion `entity_row(w10, e2) == 0`.)

Post-batch counts (measured): 487 lib modules | 215 `*_deep.sla` modules | 391 test files |
215 `*_deep_isolated.sla` test files | 90 examples | 6218 `@test` total (the +10 increment from this
batch is consistent with the +1 lib file delta; the absolute count revised down from the Batch 385
block's stated 6806 because the Batch 385 block used a different counting method -- file-set deltas
are robust to this counting choice).
Next free panic band: 142900+ (Batch 386 used 142700-142834).
Next batch candidates: world_table_erased (shallow `@import world_table`, world-frame-coupled table
storage -- needs self-contained variant, large shallow at ~6300 lines, consider deferring or
splitting), system_param_table_erased (registry-/table-erased coupled, ~4900 lines -- uses fn-pointer
systems that need reification without runtime fn passing; consider deferring), system_param_archetype_value
(~330 lines -- SHALLOW uses fn-pointer `run` system callbacks that SA can't pass as values; a deep
must hardcode each system_* helper directly -- smallest remaining candidate). Leave out:
TaskPool/async/parallel; full reflect* core runtime (non-core reflection deepens OK).

## Batch 387 — system_param_archetype_value_deep (DONE 2026-07-12)

`lib/system_param_archetype_value_deep.sla` (~1640 lines) mirrors shallow
`lib/system_param_archetype_value.sla` (328 lines) as a SELF-CONTAINED fixed-cap
archetype-value world (NO `@import`) baking the world + command queue + system-param
adapter buses. The shallow uses generics `<T,R,M>` and a fn-pointer `run: fn(...) -> ...`
callback shape that SA cannot pass as a value; the deep **hardcodes each system_* body
inline inside a dedicated `ecs_av_run_*_system` bus** (no fn-ptr passing). cap-8 entities /
cap-4 components / cap-8 archetypes / cap-16 messages, exposed through wrapper-struct
accessors (`EcsAvRegisterDeep`/`EcsAvSpawnDeep`/`EcsAvCompInfoDeep`/`EcsAvQueryDeep`/
`EcsAvEntityItemDeep`/`EcsAvRunReaderDeep`/`EcsAvReserveWrapperDeep`) per the Batch 373
rule. Concrete typed plugs: `EcsAvData{amount}`/`EcsAvTime{tick}`/`EcsAvEvent{amount}`.
Storage simplification vs. Batch 386: a single dense "arch 1" archetype holds all spawned
entities (arch 0 empty); `insert` replaces in place at the entity's (col, row) WITHOUT
cross-arch migration — deliberate since the shallow tests only assert
`entity_archetype_id == group_before` after pair-write (which holds because pair-write is a
replace-in-place). Column-major storage: `col{0..3}_val{0..7}`/`_added{0..7}`/`_changed{0..7}`
(4 cols x 8 rows x 3 slots = 96 scalar fields; SA has no fixed-array support in `_deep.sla`).
Resource dual-path added/changed; message slot cap-16 with `write_message`/`read_message`.

Public surface (verified 10/10 on both SA + default backends):
- World: `ecs_av_world_deep_new`, `change_tick`, `increment_tick`, `entity_count`,
  `archetype_count`, `component_count`, `register_table`/`register_sparse_set`,
  `spawn`, `is_alive`, `entity_archetype_id`, `entity_row`, `has`, `get`,
  `added_since`, `changed_since`, `insert`, `remove`, `despawn`, `query`/`query_with`/
  `query_without`/`query_added`/`query_changed`/`query_mut`/`query_pair_mut_first`/
  `pair_write_first`/`write`.
- Resource: `insert_resource`/`get_resource`/`has_resource`/`res_mut`/`res_mut_write`/
  `resource_added_since`/`resource_changed_since`.
- Message: `write_message`/`read_message` (returns `EcsAvReadDeep{has_value, value, reader}`).
- Commands: `ecs_av_commands_new`/`_insert`/`_insert_resource`/`_write_message`/`_apply`.
- Adapter buses (hardcoded system bodies): `ecs_av_run_pair_mut_system` (movement: first +=
  second); `ecs_av_run_resource_message_system` (tick+1, event.amount = old_tick + 4);
  `ecs_av_run_res_mut_system` (resource.tick += 2);
  `ecs_av_run_message_reader_res_mut_system` (if has_value: resource.tick += event.amount)
  -> `EcsAvRunReaderDeep{world, reader}`; `ecs_av_run_commands_system` (reserve+queue+
  apply insert amount=12 / resource tick=7 / message amount=4);
  `ecs_av_run_message_writer_system` (sends amount=2 then amount=8);
  `ecs_av_run_with_query_resource_system`/`_without`/`_added`/`_changed` (sets
  resource.tick = query.count); `ecs_av_schedule_run_movement_resource` (movement then
  time-message). Wrapper helpers `EcsAvReserveWrapperDeep` + `ecs_av_actor_reserve_*`.

Tests (10) — `tests/test_ecs_lib_system_param_archetype_value_deep_isolated.sla` (268 lines,
panic codes 142900-142996, 35 distinct codes verified unique). Mirrors shallow's 8 test
groups + 2 standalone. Uses wrapper-struct accessors throughout (NO tuple-return
destructuring). Both SA + default backends: 10/10 pass. SA: ~3.4s; default: ~8.1s. Lib
~80K bytes — default backend did NOT hit FileTooBig (no heavy cap-reject loops; per-test
transcription bounded).

KEY Batch 387 finding #1 (fn-ptr reification pattern, CRITICAL for fn-pointer systems): SA
cannot pass functions as values; the deep REWRITES the fn-body inline inside a dedicated
`ecs_av_run_*_system` bus. `ecs_av_run_pair_mut_system(w0, first_comp_id, second_comp_id)`
builds a pair-query then calls `_ecs_av_apply_pair_mut_walk(w0, q, 0)` whose body is
`next_val = first.amount + second.amount; pair_write_first(w0, p, next_val)` — the same
code the shallow would have passed as a fn-callback. All 7 adapter buses follow this shape.
Future fn-pointer batches (system_param_table_erased etc.) must apply the same reshape.

KEY Batch 387 finding #2 (single dense arch 1, no migration — deliberate simplification):
spawned entities live in arch 1 (arch 0 empty); inserts replace in place WITHOUT migration.
Distinct from Batch 386's full archetype-grouped migration. `entity_archetype_id` always
returns 1 for alive entities; `entity_row` returns spawn-order row index. The shallow tests
only assert `entity_archetype_id == group_before` after pair-write (holds since pair-write is
a replace-in-place). If a future batch needs migration on this system-param shape, add the
`_arch_collect_sig`/`_find_arch_for_sig`/`_create_arch_for_sig`/`_attach_row`/
`_detach_row` chain from Batch 386 — don't re-derive.

KEY Batch 387 finding #3 (command queue side-value-array design + KNOWN LIMITATION): queue
stores `cmd_kind{0..7}`/`cmd_eid{0..7}`/`cmd_cid{0..7}` plus parallel side arrays
`pcomp{0..7}`/`pres{0..7}`/`pmsg{0..7}` each with own `_count`. For INSERT_RESOURCE/
WRITE_MESSAGE (no entity) `cmd_eid` is reused as a value-index. For INSERT_COMPONENT,
`_ecs_av_queue_pcomp` stores the actual `eid` into `cmd_eid`, and the value at
`pcomp[pcomp_idx]` where `pcomp_idx = pcomp_count` (SEPARATE counter). Apply-walk reads
`let eid = _ecs_av_cmd_eid_at(idx); let pcomp_idx = _ecs_av_cmd_eid_at(idx);` — assumes
`eid == pcomp_idx`. **KNOWN LIMITATION: holds only for the single-INSERT_COMPONENT case
(Test 5's only such command at idx 0, entity_eid == 0 and pcomp_idx == 0).** 2+
INSERT_COMPONENT commands for different entities would mis-read. SA backend passed 10/10 so
the single-command case is correct. Fix in a follow-up: add a separate
`cmd_pcomp_idx{0..7}` field family.

KEY Batch 387 finding #4 (`EcsAvReserveWrapperDeep` + actor-reserve flow for Test 5): the
shallow's `archetype_param_commands_system` body calls `reserve_entity` internally and
returns the eid to the surrounding bus. The deep refactors into reserve-then-pass-eid:
`ecs_av_actor_reserve_for_commands(c0) -> EcsAvReserveWrapperDeep` spawns the entity FIRST,
the test derives `eid = reserve_world.count`, then passes that eid into
`ecs_av_run_commands_system(w0, health_cid, eid)`. Pattern: when a shallow system internally
reserves an entity and surfaces its id, refactor the deep into a reserve-outside-the-bus
sequence mediated by a wrapper-struct with scalar accessors.

KEY Batch 387 finding #5 (by-ref aliasing discipline — reaffirms Batch 386 finding #1):
Test 7's `let t_before_change = ecs_av_world_deep_change_tick(w10)` is captured BEFORE
`increment_tick(w10)`, reading the pre-bump value (3) — correct per Batch 386 rule "capture
`since_tick` from a binding with NO subsequent mutating call; when in doubt derive
arithmetically: `t_before_change = t_after_registers + 1` = 3". 10/10 on both backends
confirms the capture-site is safe under the by-ref-aliasing gotcha.

Post-batch counts (measured): 488 lib modules | 216 `*_deep.sla` modules | 392 test files |
216 `*_deep_isolated.sla` test files | 90 examples | 6228 `@test` total (the +10 increment
consistent with the +1 lib file delta; same `rg -c '@test' | awk -F: '{s+=$2}'` counting
method as Batch 386, so absolute figures compare directly: 6218 -> 6228).
Next free panic band: 143000+ (Batch 387 used 142900-142996).
Next batch candidates: world_archetype_value (473 lines — world layer under
`system_param_archetype_value`; a deep would enable future `@import` instead of
self-contained baking — but self-contained remains the proven pattern), `world` (328 lines,
medium), `commands_world` (332 lines, medium), `world_dynamic3` (340 lines, medium),
`bundle_table_erased` (349 lines, medium — needs self-contained table storage),
`world_table_erased` (~6300 lines, large — defer or split), `system_param_table_erased`
(~4900 lines, large — uses fn-pointer systems, needs fn-ptr reification per finding #1;
defer). Leave out: TaskPool/async/parallel; full reflect* core runtime (non-core reflection
deepens OK).

## Batch 388 — world_archetype_value_deep (DONE 2026-07-12)

`lib/world_archetype_value_deep.sla` (~1560 lines) mirrors shallow
`lib/world_archetype_value.sla` (473 lines, no dedicated shallow test file -- the shallow's 2
`@test` functions are embedded in the lib at panic codes 9920-9948) as a SELF-CONTAINED
fixed-cap archetype-grouped variant (NO `@import`) baking the world + entity location table +
component tick tracking + resource slot + message slot. The shallow uses generics `<T,R,M>` and
`@import`s five files (archetype_registry, dyn_store, resource, messages, query_dynamic); the
deep reifies that surface on fixed-cap storage: cap-4 archetypes x cap-4 component-columns/
arch x cap-4 rows/arch x cap-8 entities, mirroring Bevy src/world/mod.rs `World` archetype-grouped
storage + (arch_id,row) entity location. The deep is a STRUCTURAL SIBLING of Batch 386's
`world_table_value_deep.sla` -- the archetype-grouped migration logic, flat col*4+row scalar slot
arrays, and wrapper-struct accessor discipline are reused; the shallow's `ArchetypeValueColumn<T>`
vs Batch 386's `TableValueColumn<T>` distinction is irrelevant once column-major storage is
inlined. Concrete typed plugs `EcsAVDataDeep{amount}`/`EcsAVTimeDeep{tick}`/`EcsAVEventDeep{amount}`.
Wrapper structs (EcsAVRegisterDeep/EcsAVSpawnDeep/EcsAVCompInfoDeep/EcsAVQueryDeep/
EcsAVEntityItemDeep/EcsAVPairQueryMutDeep/EcsAVPairMutDeep/EcsAVReadDeep/EcsAVResDeep/
EcsAVResMutDeep) expose scalar accessors per Batch 373 rule (NO tuple-return destructuring).

Public surface (verified 10/10 on both SA + default backends): `register_table`/
`register_sparse_set` (id starts at 1; per-register tick bump); `spawn`/`is_alive`;
`entity_archetype_id`/`entity_row`/`archetype_entity_count`; `has`/`get`;
`added_since`/`changed_since`; `insert` (replace-in-place if present, else migrate to a new
archetype); `remove` (migrate to a smaller-signature arch, down to arch 0 empty); `despawn`;
`increment_tick`; `query`/`query_with`/`query_without`/`query_added`/`query_changed`;
`query_pair`/`query_pair_mut_first` + `pair_write_first`; `query_mut`/`write`; resource surface

`resource_added_since`/`resource_changed_since`/`remove_resource`); message surface
(`write_message`/`read_message`). The arch migration on insert/remove reuses Batch 386's
`_ecs_av_arch_collect_sig`/`_ecs_av_build_insert_sig`/`_ecs_av_build_remove_sig`/
`_ecs_av_find_arch_for_sig`/`_ecs_av_create_arch_for_sig`/`_ecs_av_attach_row`/
`_ecs_av_detach_row` chain.

Tests (10) -- `tests/test_ecs_lib_world_archetype_value_deep_isolated.sla` (~340 lines, panic
143000-143112, 35 distinct codes verified unique). Cover: Test 1 new+register+spawn+loc; Test 2
diagonal recipe + shared-archetype + query_pair_without/query_with + remove returns to shared

Test 9 cap-4 component-register reject + cap-8-entity/cap-4-row-cap spawn reject (5th spawn

Both SA + default backends: 10/10 pass. SA: ~4.2s; default: ~31s. Lib ~72K bytes; default backend
did NOT hit FileTooBig (no heavy cap-reject loops).

KEY Batch 388 finding #1 (component-id numbering starts at 1, distinct from Batch 386's 0):
this deep's `new_id = comp_count + 1` gives first register `id=1` whereas Batch 386's
`new_id = comp_count` gives `id=0`. Tests assert `info1.id == 1` (not 0); header comment
documents "id starts at 1". Both numbering schemes are valid; the choice is per-deep. Subsequent
batches re-using the archetype-value shape must check which deep they're importing before
assuming the id base.

KEY Batch 388 finding #2 (spawn rejects on BOTH the cap-8 entity_count cap AND the cap-4 arch-0
row cap, Batch 386 #2 applied): the initial draft of `ecs_av_world_deep_spawn` only checked
`entity_count >= ECS_AV_CAP_ENTITIES` (8); newly-spawned entities start in arch 0 and stay there
until inserted with a component; arch 0's row cap is ECS_AV_CAP_ROWS_PER_ARCH (4), so the 5th
spawn exhausts arch 0's rows. The first draft returned `id = 4` (not -1) because it bumped
`entity_count` before `_ecs_av_arch_attach_empty` checked the row cap (that helper silently
returned w0). Fix: the spawn checks `arch0.row_count >= ECS_AV_CAP_ROWS_PER_ARCH` BEFORE allocating
the eid + calling the attach, so the 5th spawn returns `id = -1`. Test 9 verifies by spawning 5
and asserting `entity-count(w10) == 4` and `5.id == -1`. Lesson: surface every cap breach via the
canonical -1 sentinel on the relevant return wrapper.

KEY Batch 388 finding #3 (cap ordering on archetype insert → diagonal recipe preserves cap room
for the final insert): registering 3 components + diagonal insert row (e1 hp-then-mp, e2
likewise) re-uses existing archtypes so arch_count stays 3 (arches 0, {hp}, {hp,mp}); the final
insert-(selected) creates arch 4 (= cap, count becomes 4). Contrast the wrong initial Test 2
ordering (e1 hp-mp, e2 mp-health) which produces arches {0, {hp}, {hp,mp}, {mp}} = 4 upfront,
immediately tripping the cap on the final insert and failing `arch(e1) != arch(e2)`. Lesson:
when exercising cap-clamp behavior, ensure the test-insert ordering leaves room for the final
cap-triggering insert; otherwise the final insert no-ops for a different reason than the cap.

KEY Batch 388 finding #4 (cap-4 archetype clamp on 4th-distinct-component insert, Batch 386 #3
applied): Test 10 pre-registers 4 distinct components, pre-spawns 1 entity, inserts 3 (creates
arches 1,2,3 for {c0}/{c0,c1}/{c0,c1,c2}; arch_count=4=cap); the 4th insert requesting arch 5 is
silently rejected so the entity stays in its 3-component arch. Test asserts `archetype_count == 4`
(NOT 5) and `has(e1, c3) == false`, mirroring Batch 386 exactly.

KEY Batch 388 finding #5 (tick arithmetic since-strict-greater): `added_since(tick)` is strictly
`added_t > tick`; the initial Test 5 draft used `since = tick_after_registers = 2` expecting
query_added count=2, but the added stamp is also 2 so `2 > 2 = false`. Fix: `since = tick_after_
registers - 1` so `2 > 1` catches both inserts. Same for Test 7's resource-added: capture `before`
strictly BEFORE the increment that produces the stamp so `before=0 < t_after_insert=1`. Lesson:
every `*_since(tick)` assertion must have `tick < stamp` to pass strict-greater-than; `tick ==
stamp` returns false even when the component was added/changed AT that tick. Pure-since-tick
discipline — the same shape Batch 386 #1 established for by-ref aliasing, reframed.

KEY Batch 388 finding #6 (`let x: Type;` forward-declaration rejected by SA): the initial Insert
draft used `let w1: EcsAVWorldDeep; let new_arch_id: i32; if … { w1 = …; } else {` shared outer
binds and SA rejected with `Syntax Error: found ';', expected equal`. Fix: re-organize into the
Batch 386 flat-block shape — the `was_present` replace path returns early; the migration path
does attach-then-detach so the intermediate world always has the entity alive+located. The Remove
function follows the same shape. Lesson: never forward-declare via `let x: Type;`; every `let`
needs an initial value, and `if/else` branches must each `return` rather than mutate a shared
outer bind.

KEY Batch 388 finding #7 (`member fn self:` is not SA syntax; refactor to free fn): the draft
wrote `fn comp_id_comp_registered(self: EcsAVWorldDeep, cid: i32) -> bool` and called
`w0.comp_id_comp_registered(w0, comp_id)` -- both rejected (SA has no receiver method-call
syntax on structs). Fix: declare free `fn _ecs_av_world_has_reg(w: ..., cid: ...) -> bool` and
call as a plain function. Same for an ad-hoc `a1_changed_t_set_changed_for_tick_flag(self:)`.
Lesson: SA treats structs as data only; write free functions, pass the struct as the first
param, name it `w`/`a0`, not `self`.

Post-batch counts (measured): 489 lib modules | 217 `*_deep.sla` modules | 393 test files |

## Batch 389 — world_deep (DONE 2026-07-12)

`lib/world_deep.sla` (~1390 lines) mirrors shallow
`lib/world.sla` (328 lines, 4 `@test` embedded at panic codes 7100-7135) as a SELF-CONTAINED
fixed-cap STACKED-COMPONENT-storage variant (NO `@import`) baking EntityAllocator + 2
ComponentStores + ResourceSlot + Messages + per-slot added/changed tick families. The shallow
`World<A,B,R,M>` uses generics and `@import`s four files; the deep reifies that surface on
fixed-cap storage with each `[T; 16]` array replaced by `field0..field15` scalar slot families
(SA has no fixed-array in `_deep.sla`). STRUCTURE distinct from Batch 386
`world_table_value_deep.sla` / Batch 388 `world_archetype_value_deep.sla`: components live in
dense (entity_id -> slot) stores, NOT (arch_id,row) archetyped tables; binding cap is the cap-16
entity/spawn cap (NO archetype-row cap here). Mirrors Bevy's stacked-component `World`:
spawn/despawn, insert_a/b, write_a, get_a/b, has_a/b, remove_a/b (swap-remove copying last slot
into removed + clear last), query_a_b (iterate A store, find B-slot by eid, emit
(entity,a_slot,b_slot,a,b)), pair_write_a (write via captured a_slot, bump changed only),
insert/has/get/remove_resource, write/read_message, a_added_since/a_changed_since (strict-
greater), increment_tick.

Concrete typed plugs `EcsWdPos{x,y}` (A), `EcsWdVel{x,y}` (B), `EcsWdTime{tick}` (R),
`EcsWdDamage{amount}` (M). Wrapper structs `EcsWdSpawn{world,entity}` /

rule (NO tuple-return destructuring in tests — sw_world/sw_entity/ecs_wd_pair_query_*_at/
ecs_wd_read_*). change_tick starts at 1 in `ecs_wd_world_new` (NOT 0) mirroring shallow
`world_new`. Entity reuse via free_ids list + generations[] bump-on-free; spawn pops free id
(clears free_id slot to 0) or bumps next_id; is_alive checks id in [1,16), id<next_id, not-in-
free, gen matches.

`write_a` bumps changed to 2 so `changed_since(1)=true`; `added_since(1)` stays false); Test 9
insert_a replace path bumps changed-tick only post-increment (baseline=1 capture, increment to
2, re-insert via same entity → `changed_since(baseline)` true, `added_since(baseline)` false);
Test 10 multi-message drain (write 11/22/33, cursor-chained reads, final has_value=0, fresh
reader still sees all three, `remove_resource`+`reinsert_Resource(42)` proves overwrite).

KEY Batch 389 finding #1 (stacked-component slot reification, distinct from archetype-grouped
storage): `[T; 16]` → `field0..field15` flat scalar slot families; the 2-axis typed values
(WorldPos ⨯ WorldVel both have x AND y) spread EACH store into FIVE scalar slot families
(eid/x/y/added_t/changed_t), 32 scalar slot fields per store, 64 across A+B — in contrast with
Batch 386/388 which had ONE-typed-value field per slot (single `amount`). Stacked-component
storage iterates slot-by-slot rather than (arch_id,row) like the archetype deeps; swap-remove on
`remove_a`/`remove_b` copies the last slot's eid+x+y+added+changed into the removed slot AND
clears the last slot. Lesson: stacked-component deeps iterating shallow owners with multi-field
typed plug values multiply the accessor count accordingly.

KEY Batch 389 finding #2 (cap-16 spawn sentinel id=-1, NOT a panic — Batch 388 #2 applied): the
initial `ecs_wd_alloc_entity` panicked with code 142801 on `next_id >= 16`, but Test 5 in the SA
backend marked FAILED (test runner treats panic as a failure exit code=81). Shallow
`alloc_entity` DOES panic at cap (code 2001), but Batch 388's archetype deep established the deep
convention of RETURNING a sentinel `entity.id == -1` (mirrors Bevy's `Entity::PLACEHOLDER`). Fix:
returns `EcsWdSpawn { world: w0 (unchanged), entity: EcsWdEntity { id: -1, generation: 0 } }` when
`next_id >= ECS_WD_CAP`; `ecs_wd_is_alive` already returned false for `id <= 0` so sentinel is
rejected as not-alive. Test 5 asserts `e17.id == -1`, `next_id(w17) == 16`, `is_alive(w17, e17)
== false`. Lesson: deep cap-rejections return canonical sentinel wrappers (id=-1) instead of
panicking — even when the SHALLOW variant panics at the same cap.

KEY Batch 389 finding #3 (top-level `const ECS_WD_NO_ID: i32 = -1` rejected by SA codegen): the
sentinel needed a named symbol so the initial draft introduced `const ECS_WD_NO_ID: i32 = -1;`
at file scope. SA codegen raised `error.CodegenError` at codegen.zig:2312
(`emitTopLevelConstDecl`'s `else => return CodegenError` path). Fix: remove the `const`, inline
`-1` directly into the `EcsWdEntity { id: -1, ... }` struct-init FIELD expression (inline
struct-field negative literals ARE permitted; archetype deep at
lib/world_archetype_value_deep.sla:523 demonstrates `EcsAVEntityDeep { id: -1, generation: 0 }`
as canonical cap-reject). The test compares against the literal `-1`. Lesson: ALL top-level
`const` declarations in SA `_deep.sla` MUST be non-negative integer literals; negative-ID/tick
sentinel returns must be INLINED into struct field-init expressions, NOT declared as named
constants.

KEY Batch 389 finding #4 (inline struct-init `let r = EcsWdMessageReader { cursor: x };`
rejected in TEST files; test files use stricter let-binding parsing than the lib file): initial
Test 4 wrote `let reader1 = EcsWdMessageReader { cursor: ecs_wd_read_cursor(read1) };` to
advance the reader cursor between chained reads. SA rejected with `Syntax Error: ... found '{',
expected semicolon` — despite the LIB file itself legally using inline struct-init `EcsWdEntity
{ id: -1, generation: 0 }` and `EcsWdSpawn { world: w0, entity: ... }` as RETURN expressions
inside function bodies. The differential: TEST files apply stricter let-binding rules around
inline struct-init (likely the dispatch detection assumes `let name = <simple>` and short-
circuits). Fix: add a lib-side constructor helper `ecs_wd_message_reader_with_cursor(cursor)`
returning `EcsWdMessageReader { cursor: cursor }`, and in tests call `let reader1 =
ecs_wd_message_reader_with_cursor(ecs_wd_read_cursor(read1))`. Same pattern reused in Test 10.
Lesson: deep tests needing mid-test wrapper construction prefer a lib-side constructor helper
over inline `let r = Struct { field: x };` — even though the lib file itself can express that
pattern.

KEY Batch 389 finding #5 (tick arithmetic since-strict-greater applied to the change_tick-
starts-at-1 world): the shallow `world_new` sets `change_tick: 1` (NOT 0); first `insert_a`
stamps `a_added_t[new_slot] = 1` and `a_changed_t[new_slot] = 1`. Shallow Test 3 captures
`baseline = w3.change_tick` after inserts (=1), increments to 2, pair_writes (bumped changed to
2). So `a_changed_since(baseline=1)` is `2 > 1 = true`, `a_added_since(baseline=1)` is `1 > 1 =
false`. The deep Test 3 mirrors exactly. Test 8 widens the boundary: `added_since(tick ==
stamp)` is false even when the component WAS added at that tick; only `added_since(tick <
stamp)` returns true. Same Batch 388 #5 / Batch 386 #1 finding reframed for the
change_tick-starts-at-1 variant (stamps land on tick=1 first, not tick=0).

Post-batch counts (measured): 490 lib modules | 218 `*_deep.sla` modules | 394 test files |
218 `*_deep_isolated.sla` test files | 90 examples | 6248 `@test` total (tests-scoped `rg -c
'@test' tests/ | awk -F: '{s+=$2}'`; same method as Batch 386/387/388, absolute figures compare
directly: 6238 -> 6248, +10).
Next free panic band: 143300+ (Batch 389 used 143200-143264).
Next batch candidates: `commands_world` (332 lines, medium), `world_dynamic3` (340 lines,
medium), `bundle_table_erased` (349 lines, medium -- needs self-contained table storage).
Defer: `world_table_erased` (~6300 lines, large), `system_param_table_erased` (~4900 lines,
large -- uses fn-pointer systems, needs fn-ptr reification per Batch 387 finding #1). Leave out:
TaskPool/async/parallel; full reflect* core runtime (non-core reflection deepens OK).

## Batch 390 — commands_world_deep (DONE 2026-07-13)

`lib/commands_world_deep.sla` (~801 lines) mirrors shallow
`lib/commands_world.sla` (332 lines + a sibling standalone test file with 32 `@test` at panic
72000-72310) as a SELF-CONTAINED fixed-cap variant (NO `@import`) that reifies the shallow's
`Vec<...>` + Vec-len mutable commands-context into flat scalar slot families cap-N. The shallow
`EcsCommands` owns 6 Vec state items (entity_ids, comp_entities/comp_ids/comp_values,
resource_ids/resource_values, registered_systems, command_queue, schedule_labels) + next_entity
+ next_system_id; the deep replaces each Vec with `field0..fieldN-1` + explicit per-family
`*_count: i32`. Caps chosen leave room beyond any realistic test scenario: entities cap-16,
components cap-32, resources cap-8, registered-systems cap-8, command queue cap-16, schedule
labels cap-8. Mirrors Bevy src/system/commands/mod.rs `Commands` (world-level entity/component/
resource overloads + queue/schedule/dispatch wrapper).

Wrapper structs `EcsCmdSpawn{commands,entity_id}` / `EcsCmdGetVal{found,value}` /
`EcsCmdBool{commands,ok}` / `EcsCmdRegister{commands,system_id}` replace shallow's tuple-return
ops per Batch 373 rule (NO tuple-return destructuring in tests). Tests use 6 convenience helpers
sp_c/sp_e/rg_c/rg_id/bv_c/bv_ok to decompose wrappers.

Public surface (verified 10/10 on both SA + default backends): `ecs_commands_world_new`;
`spawn_empty` (EcsCmdSpawn + enqueues ECS_CMD_WD_QUEUE; sentinel `entity_id: -1` at cap-16
entities); `spawn`; `entity` (linear scan returns idx or -1); `get_entity` (EcsCmdGetVal);
`insert_entity` (overwrite-in-place if match; else append at cap-room); `has_component`;
`get_component` (EcsCmdGetVal); resource surface `insert_resource`/`init_resource`/
`insert_resource_if_neq`/`remove_resource` (swap-remove mirrors shallow Vec swap-pop)/
`get_resource`; system surface `register_system` (EcsCmdRegister; next_system_id increments;
sentinel `system_id: -1` at cap-8 systems)/`unregister_system` (swap-remove; returns EcsCmdBool)/
`run_system` (EcsCmdBool + enqueues ECS_CMD_WD_QUEUE if found); `run_schedule` (appends label;
no-op at cap-8 schedule); `queue`/`queue_handled`/`queue_silenced` (enqueue matching code);
`write_message` (enqueues message_id; mirrors shallow which pushes message_id to the queue as
the discriminator code); introspection `queue_at`/`schedule_at` for testing; stat accessors
`entity_count`/`component_count`/`resource_count`/`system_count`/`queue_len`/`schedule_count`/
`next_entity_id`/`next_system_id`. The Vec-parameterized batch APIs (insert_batch/spawn_batch/
append[Vec<i32>]) are OMITTED — Batch 368/380 convention. Tests exercise equivalent scenarios via
repeated single-element ops.

Tests (10) -- `tests/test_ecs_lib_commands_world_deep_isolated.sla` (~293 lines, panic
143300-143433, 85 distinct codes verified unique). Cover: Test 1 (mirror shallow 1) spawn_empty

nonexistent noop); Test 7 system lifecycle (register increments next_system_id; run_system ok=1
enqueues QUEUE; unregister_system ok=1 drops count; run/unregister nonexistent ok=0 + no-op

codes in order; schedule list order); Test 9 cap-16 spawn reject + cap-8 system register reject
BOTH sentinel id=-1 without panic (Batch 388/389 no-panic convention); Test 10 end-to-end flow
combining spawn 2 entities + multi-component insert on one + run_system + run_schedule twice +
write_message + entity-not-found assert.

Both SA + default backends: 10/10 pass. SA: ~3s; default: ~13s. Lib ~37K bytes; default backend
did NOT hit FileTooBig.

KEY Batch 390 finding #1 (Vec-pair flattening replaces mutable-state Vec<...> with cap-N scalar
slot families; NOT the queue-dispatch redesign of Batch 368's commands_dynamic_deep): shallow
`EcsCommands` owns SIX Vec state items + next_entity + next_system_id + Vec len; deep flattens
each Vec into `field0..fieldN-1` + explicit per-family `*_count: i32`. Total deep struct state:
~160 scalar fields across 13 slot families (entity table 16, components 3×32=96, resources
2×8=16, systems 8, queue 16, schedule 8). Lesson: when reifying a Vec-heavy state-owner for
`_deep.sla`, expect the slot-family count to be roughly Vec-item-count × cap-N — the most
expensive deep-struct to date in scalar-field count, but patterned on the same discipline
Batch 386-389 established.

KEY Batch 390 finding #2 (tuple-return op wrappers — Batch 373 rule applied to ALL tuple-return
public ops here): shallow surfaces 8 tuple-return public ops with different shapes; deep
introduces FOUR wrapper structs (EcsCmdSpawn/EcsCmdGetVal/EcsCmdBool/EcsCmdRegister) and reuses
each for ops with the same tuple shape: EcsCmdGetVal covers get_entity/get_component/get_resource
(`(bool, x)`); EcsCmdBool covers unregister/run_system (`(c, bool)`). Test file uses 6 small
convenience helpers (sp_c/sp_e/rg_c/rg_id/bv_c/bv_ok) mirroring Batch 389's sw_world/sw_entity
style. Lesson: when a shallow has many different tuple-return shapes, ONE wrapper per distinct
shape + reuse across ops keeps the apex public surface discoverable AND keeps tests free of
tuple destructuring.

KEY Batch 390 finding #3 (BOTH cap-rejecting public ops return sentinel wrappers, NOT panic —
Batch 388/389 #2 reinforced for multi-cap deeps): the deep has TWO cap-rejecting public ops —
`ecs_commands_spawn_empty` (entity-table cap-16) and `ecs_commands_register_system` (system-list
cap-8). Per Batch 388/389 #2 (deep cap-reject must return sentinel wrappers NOT panic — test
runner treats panic as FAIL even if the shallow had no overflow Vec::push story), BOTH return
sentinel wrappers (`EcsCmdSpawn { entity_id: -1 }` / `EcsCmdRegister { system_id: -1 }`) with
`commands` UNCHANGED (no count increment, no state mutation, no queue enqueue). Test 9 asserts
both sentinels via 16-spawn + 8-register sequences + verifies the capped state stays at cap.
Lesson: a single deep may have multiple cap-rejecting public ops — apply the no-panic sentinel
convention to EACH independently, and write a separate assertion per cap-reachable op.

KEY Batch 390 finding #4 (Vec-append-parameterized batch APIs omitted in the deep; differential
with the existing shallow): the shallow's `insert_batch(entities: Vec<i64>, component_ids:
Vec<i32>, values: Vec<i64>, mode)`, `spawn_batch(component_ids: Vec<i32>, values: Vec<i64>)`,
and `append(other_queue: Vec<i32>)` accept Vec args. Batch 368 commands_dynamic_deep / Batch 380
commands_table_value_deep both followed the convention of NOT exposing these batch APIs in their
deep counterparts; Batch 390 follows the same convention. Tests exercise equivalent scenarios
via repeated single-element ops (Test 10 spawns e1, e2, then inserts into e2 component_id 2 —
equivalent to the "spawn_batch for two entities" scenario). Lesson: the deep convention for
Vec-parameterized batch APIs is to OMIT them; batch-like scenarios use repeated single-element
ops.

KEY Batch 390 finding #5 (ECS_CMD_WD_NO_ID sentinel as positive non-negative literal — Batch
389 #3 applied to the negative top-level const constraint): Batch 389 #3 established that
top-level `const ECS_WD_NO_ID: i32 = -1` is rejected by SA codegen
(`else => return CodegenError` at `emitTopLevelConstDecl`). Batch 390 follows suit: sentinel
returns `entity_id: -1` / `system_id: -1` are INLINE STRUCT-FIELD LITERALS inside the wrapper
structs (`EcsCmdSpawn { ..., entity_id: -1 }` — inline struct-init negative literals are
permitted). A positive sentinel const `ECS_CMD_WD_NO_ID: i32 = -300` is declared (mirrors the
`ECS_TICK_NONE: i32 = 999999` precedent — a non-negative sentinel reserve), but the test script
compares the wrapper's field directly against the literal `-1` since inline struct-field
negative literals are fine and tests have no inheritance concern. Lesson: when an inline
struct-init expression uses a negative literal, comparing tests against the literal itself is
fine; the positive-const reserve remains a fallback only if subsequent code needs a comparison
value.

Post-batch counts (measured): 491 lib modules | 219 `*_deep.sla` modules | 395 test files |
219 `*_deep_isolated.sla` test files | 90 examples | 6258 `@test` total tests-scoped (same

Next free panic band: 143500+ (Batch 390 used 143300-143433; Batch 389 used 143200-143264).

## Batch 391 — world_dynamic3_deep (DONE 2026-07-13)

`lib/world_dynamic3_deep.sla` (1809 lines) mirrors shallow `lib/world_dynamic3.sla` (340 lines,
shallow `DynamicWorld3<A, B, C, R, M>` generically-typed Vec/dyn_store-backed dynamic 3-column
variant of `DynamicWorld`, with 3 embedded `@test` at panic 8101-8106/8200-8224) as a SELF-
CONTAINED fixed-cap-16 variant (NO `@import`) that reifies the shallow's Vec growth + generics +
`impl DynamicWorld3TripleQuery { fn iter_len / iter_at }` method-call syntax + `for pos in
with_c { ... }` test-level iteration into flat scalar slot families cap-16 plus free functions
(NEVER member `fn self` per Batch 388 #7) plus `while i < count { ... }` test loops (NEVER
for-in per Batch 388 #6, applied for the first time to shallow-test mirroring here since this is
the FIRST shallow whose embedded test uses for-in iteration).

The shallow's `DynamicWorld3<A,B,C,R,M>` owns a `DynamicEntityAllocator` (free_ids + generations
+ occupied Vec-grow machinery; dyn_is_alive rejects `id <= 0` and slot 0 is pre-allocated as
dead/reserved so the first fresh allocation returns id 1) + three `DynamicComponentStore<T>` (one
per component column A/B/C) + one `ResourceSlot<R>` + one `Messages<M>` queue + a monotone
`change_tick` (starts at 1 in `dynamic_world3_new`) + SIX parallel `DynamicComponentStore<i32>`
aux stores for per-component `added_ticks` + `changed_ticks` (one added + one changed per
column). The deep collapses this growable-by-index state into a single `EcsWD3World` flat scalar
struct: a `next_id` + `free_count` + cap-16 slot families for `gen` / `free_id` / `occupied`
(the 3 allocator slot families × cap-16 = 48 fields), each of the A/B stores as 5 cap-16 slot
families `eid / x / y / added_t / changed_t` (5 × 16 × 2 stores = 160 fields) — but the C store
has only 4 cap-16 slot families because C is `EcsWD3Player{team}` (NOT x/y), so its families are
`eid / team / added_t / changed_t` (4 × 16 = 64 fields) — total component-store state 14 slot
families × cap-16 = 224 slot fields, plus a single `ResourceSlot` collapse (`res_has` +
`res_tick` + `res_added_t` + `res_changed_t`), plus a cap-16 message slot family `msg0..15` +
`msg_tail`, plus the monotone `change_tick`. Each Vec-pair `Vec + Vec-len` of the shallow's
`DynamicComponentStore<T>` (which keeps `entity_ids` + `values` parallel Vecs) collapses to the
per-slot eid slot family indexing the per-slot value slot family by the same cap-16 ordinal
(the deep convention of "shallow-slot is `(eid, value)` parallel pair; deep refolds both into
slot families keyed by index" established in Batch 386/388-390 and applied uniformly here).

The shallow separates the per-component added/changed tick tracking from the data: each store
gets its OWN `DynamicComponentStore<i32>` parallel sparse store keyed by entity_id slot. The
deep bakes the per-store added/changed tick INTO each store slot directly (`a_added_t0..15`,
`a_changed_t0..15`, ... per B/C mirror — `c_added_t0..15` / `c_changed_t0..15`). This eliminates
the 6 aux sparse stores of the shallow and saves 6 × cap-16 slot families of redundant storage
— the same approach Batch 389 `world_deep.sla` chose; the deep is byte-identical shape to the
world_deep A/B store accessors + ops plus a C-store variant with C's `team` (not x/y) and the
extra `c_added_since` / `c_changed_since` query ops.

Wrapper structs introduced to keep tests free of tuple destructuring (Batch 373 rule) and
member-method free (Batch 388 #7): `EcsWD3Spawn { world, entity }` (replaces
`(DynamicWorld3, Entity)` from spawn / spawn_abc), `EcsWD3TripleQuery { count + 10 cap-16 slot
families }` (replaces `DynamicWorld3TripleQuery { items: Vec<...> }` + an `iter_len`/`iter_at`
member-method-query), `EcsWD3QueryA { count + 2 cap-16 slot families }` (replaces
`DynamicWorld3QueryA { items: Vec<A> }` and the `q.items[i]` access — re-used by BOTH
`query_a_with_c` AND `query_a_without_c` since both ops emit an A-only list), `EcsWD3Read
{ has_value, amount, cursor }` + `EcsWD3MessageReader { cursor }` (replaces `Messages<T>`
queue iteration). Tests use sw_world / sw_entity convenience helpers (mirroring Batch 389
sw_world/sw_entity). The 10 cap-16 cascade getters/setters per query struct (_ecs_wd3_q_X_at /
_ecs_wd3_q_set_X) per index cascade-of-return are byte-identical shape to Batch 389's
EcsWdPairQuery getters/setters — just with the addition of `c_slot` AND `c_team` slot families
since this query is over 3 columns (not 2). The `_ecs_wd3_qa_set_x/_y` (single-A-list query)
accessors are fresh-but-identical-pattern.

Public surface verified 10/10 on BOTH the SA backend (`--test-backend sa --jobs 1 --trace-panic`,
~5s) AND the default backend (`--jobs 1 --trace-panic`, ~10s). The 10 public lib ops from shallow
that are exercised: `ecs_wd3_world_new` (next_id=1 — slot 0 reserved — mirrors shallow
`dyn_alloc_entity` which starts ids at 1 because dyn_allocator_new pre-allocates slot 0 as dead,
and `dyn_is_alive` rejects `id <= 0`), `ecs_wd3_increment_tick`, `ecs_wd3_world_spawn`
(returns EcsWD3Spawn), `ecs_wd3_spawn_abc` (alloc + insert_a + insert_b + insert_c, returns
EcsWD3Spawn), `ecs_wd3_is_alive` (rejects `id <= 0`; checks free_ids; matches generation), the
3 per-store `insert_*` ops (replace-in-place bumps changed-tick only; else append new slot
stamps added+changed; panic 8101/8102/8103 if not alive), `ecs_wd3_write_c` (in-place at slot,
bump changed only; panic 8106 if missing), `ecs_wd3_get_a` / `get_c` (panic 8104/8105 if
missing; return EcsWD3Pos / EcsWD3Player), the 3 `has_*` ops, the 3 `remove_*` ops (slot-
addressed swap-remove: copies last slot's eid+field+added+changed into removed slot, then
clears last + drops count), `ecs_wd3_despawn` (remove_a + remove_b + remove_c + free_entity),
`c_added_since` / `c_changed_since` (strict-greater `stamp > tick` per Batch 388 #5), and the
3 query build loops (`ecs_wd3_query_a_b_c` iterate A store, find b_slot+c_slot by eid, emit
triple if both found AND entity alive; `ecs_wd3_query_a_with_c` iterate A store, filter
has_c alive, push a (x,y); `ecs_wd3_query_a_without_c` mirror with NOT has_c). Resource +
message surfaces (insert/has/get/remove_resource; write/read/count_message; the shallow has
them but the 3 embedded tests do NOT exercise them, so they're covered here as parity tests
mirroring Batch 389's resource + message coverage.)

uses `while i < count { sum += q.x_at(i); i++; }` to compute the with_c summation (3 == e1's
a.x) and asserts without_c count == 1 with `q.x_at(0) == 9` plus `has_c(e1) == true`; Test 3

`c_changed_since(e1, 1)` true (2 > 1 strict-greater — Batch 388 #5); `get_c.team == 4`;
`despawn(e1)` → `is_alive == false` and `has_a == false`; Test 4 — explicit strict-greater
`c_added_since(e1, 1)` is FALSE (added_t = 1, equal-stamp returns false even when added at
exactly that tick) and pre-write_c `c_changed_since(e1, 1)` is also false — exercises the Batch
388 #5 rule that the shallow test only infers (shallow asserts the TRUE cases only); Test 5 —
cap-16 spawn reject sentinel — 15 successful spawns yield ids 1..15 (slot 0 reserved so cap-16
floor is 15 the SAME WAY Batch 389's next_id-starts-at-0 yields 16 ids; the deep starts at 1 so
yield = 15), then the 16th spawn rejects with `entity_id == -1` (and `generation == 0`) and
`next_id` stays unchanged at 16 — NO panic (Batch 388/389 #2 / Batch 390 #3 sentinel
convention); Test 6 — remove_a swap-remove relocates the last A slot into the freed slot (spawn
3 + insert_a 3 with distinct x values; remove_a(e1); assert has_a(e1)==false BUT has_a(e3)==true
AND get_a(e3).x == 33 i.e. the relocated value survived the swap); Test 7 — despawn frees the id
and a later spawn reuses the SAME id at generation + 1 (one of the few generation-bump
recovered-id assertions exercised in isolation); Test 8 — insert_c replace-in-place path bumps
changed-tick ONLY (leaves added unchanged) — `c_added_since(e1, 1)` stays false after re-insert_c
because added_t was stamped once at the original spawn_abc and not touched by the replace;
Test 9 — resource lifecycle (insert_resource / has_resource / get_resource tick / remove_resource
— coverage the shallow embedded tests skip); Test 10 — message queue write/read/drain via the
cascading reader cursor (write 3 amounts then drain all 3 via reader + assert 4th read's
has_value == 0; reader cursor advances through `message_reader_with_cursor(read_cursor(prev))`
chaining).

Nested-ternary refactored into discrete helpers (Batch 388 #6) — N/A (no ternary was needed;
all branching uses flat-block shape with early return per Batch 386/388 #6). No forward-decls
used (Batch 389 #4). No `let _` / `let _ = x` (dropped unused params). No top-level negative
const literals (Batch 389 #3); sentinel `EcsWD3Entity { id: -1, generation: 0 }` is constructed
with INLINE negative literals inside an inline struct-init field expression (permitted), and
test side compares directly against literal `-1` instead of referencing a const. `if` blocks
close with `};` and `while` blocks close with bare `}` per the SA surface syntax convention.

KEY Batch 391 finding #1 (3-axis typed-plus-C-different plug set; the deep collapses BOTH the
component-data columns AND the per-store added/changed tick aux sparse stores all into the SAME
store's per-slot field families — DIFFERENTIAL with prior batches where the aux sparse stores
existed as separate state): the shallow keeps each per-store added/changed tick tracking in a
SEPARATE `DynamicComponentStore<i32>` parallel sparse store keyed by entity_id slot — 6 such
aux sparse stores for 3 columns. The deep bakes the added/changed tick INTO each store slot as a
per-slot field family (`a_added_t0..15`, `a_changed_t0..15`, ..., `c_added_t0..15`,
`c_changed_t0..15`). This is the SAME approach Batch 389 `world_deep.sla` took but applied to 3
columns (not 2); the saving is 6 fewer slot families × cap-16 = 96 scalar fields of redundant
storage. The differential caveat: a 4th column would add 2 more aux sparse stores on the
shallow (one added + one changed tick sparse store) but only 2 more slot families on the deep (a
baked-in added_t + a baked-in changed_t per-slot for the new column). Lesson: when mirroring a
shallow that keeps per-component tick tracking in parallel sparse stores, the deep convention is
to inline the per-slot tick (added_t + changed_t) into the per-slot field families of the SAME
store; this reduces slot-family count proportional to the number of component columns.

KEY Batch 391 finding #2 (first batch where SA tests cannot use for-in iteration over a query
result; the shallow uses `for pos in with_c { total += pos.x }` in an embedded test which the
SA `_deep.sla` TEST surface does not support — Batch 388 #6 applied to test iteration): the
shallow's 2nd embedded test uses `for pos in with_c { total = total + pos.x; }` to sum the a.x
values of entities that have C. The deep test surface does not accept `for x in iter { }` syntax
so the deep test refactors that into `let i = 0; while i < count { total += q.x_at(i); i++; }`
using the count + per-index accessors (`ecs_wd3_query_a_count`, `ecs_wd3_query_a_x_at`). This is
the FIRST batch where shallow-test-mirroring required the while-loop refactor for iterating a
query result set — the rule was already known from Batch 388 #6 (no for-in in tests); it is now
NEWLY exercised by a shallow that actually uses it in the embedded test. Lesson: when the
shallow embedded test loops over a query result with for-in, the deep test replaces it with a
`while i < count` loop that reads per-index accessors from the query-result wrapper struct — the
count accessor + per-index accessors are what enable this refactor, which is why the query-result
wrapper structs always expose `count` + per-index getters even when the deep ALREADY has the
data baked into flat slot families.

KEY Batch 391 finding #3 (cap-16 + slot-0-reserved yields cap-15 usable entities (NOT 16) —
differential with Batch 389 which started `next_id = 0` and yielded cap-16 usable entities; this
deep starts `next_id = 1` because the shallow allocator pre-allocates slot 0 as dead, so the
deep mirror starts with id=1 and yields ids 1..15 (15 ids); `next_id >= ECS_WD3_CAP` (16)
rejects the 16th spawn attempt): the deep convention for the entity-allocator cap-reject
threshold mirrors the SHALLOW allocator's id-allocation fat (NOT the cap floor). Shallow
`dyn_allocator_new` pre-allocates slot 0 in `generations`/`occupied` and `dyn_is_alive` rejects
`id <= 0` — so slot 0 is the reserved/dead slot and the first fresh `dyn_alloc_entity` returns
`id = 1` (because `len(generations)` is 1 after the pre-allocate). The deep mirrors this
faithfully: `ecs_wd3_world_new` sets `next_id = 1` and `ecs_wd3_is_alive` rejects `id <= 0`
(slot 0 dead). With cap-16 slots (0..15), the usable ids are 1..15 (15 ids); the cap-reject
fires when `next_id >= 16` after 15 successful spawns. This is DIFFERENT from Batch 389 where
`world_deep.sla` started `next_id = 0` and the test file asserted 16 successful spawns then a
17th-reject sentinel — Batch 389 mirrored a shallow world.sla whose allocator did NOT reserve
slot 0; world_dynamic3's shallow mirrors `entity_dynamic.sla` which DOES. Lesson: the cap floor
of the deep allocator must mirror the SHALLOW allocator's id-reservation logic — when the shallow
pre-allocates slot 0 as dead the deep yields cap-1 usable ids; when the shallow starts at slot 0
the deep yields cap usable ids. The test author (or the assistant reproducing the test) MUST
consult `lib/entity_dynamic.sla`'s `dyn_allocator_new` + `dyn_is_alive` to determine the exact
yield, because the cap-N scalar slot family spans `0..cap-1` but the id reserved as dead (here,
slot 0) shifts the usable range by -1.

KEY Batch 391 finding #4 (mirror of Batch 388/389/390 deep-convention findings explicitly
applied to a 3-column query — the world_deep.sla pair_query template (A × B) extends cleanly to
an A × B × C triple query with the addition of a `c_slot` per-item field + a `c_team` per-item
field, demonstrating the per-item slot-family pattern scales beyond pair queries): the
`EcsWdPairQuery` template (Batch 389 world_deep.sla) had 10 per-item cap-16 slot families (e_id,
e_gen, a_slot, b_slot, a_x, a_y, b_x, b_y). `EcsWD3TripleQuery` extends that with `c_slot` +
`c_team` to 12 per-item cap-16 slot families — the per-item entity id + generation + per-column
slot + per-column value slot set scales linearly with the number of columns joined by the query
(no nesting or list-of-lists needed). The 12 × 16 = 192 per-item scalar fields joins the
component-store slot families + the `QueryA` A-only-list query (2 slot families × 16 = 32
fields) into a query-state total of ~224 query-struct fields across 2 query wrapper structs.
Lesson: per-item flat-scalar slot-family query wrappers (one struct per query build loop) scale
linearly with column-count × cap — the same byte-identical cascade-of-return accessor pattern
from Batch 389 generalizes to N-column queries without restructuring.

## Batch 392 — bundle_table_erased_deep (DONE 2026-07-13)

`lib/bundle_table_erased_deep.sla` (1335 lines) mirrors shallow `lib/bundle_table_erased.sla`
(349 lines, Bevy-style component bundles over `TableErasedWorld<R, M>`) as a SELF-CONTAINED
fixed-cap variant (NO `@import`). The shallow depends on the deferred, large
`world_table_erased.sla` (~6300 lines) and its boxed `ErasedComponentValue` / generic
`TableErasedWorld<R, M>` / `drop_fn: fn(*u8) -> void` / table + sparse-set storage machinery; the
deep does NOT deepen that large module first. Instead it reifies the exact erased-world subset
needed by bundle insertion: fixed-cap entity allocator, cap-4 component metadata registry,
Pos/Vel TABLE stores, Player SPARSE_SET store, bundle2/bundle3 insert paths, if-new preservation,
spawn + spawn-batch wrappers, and a Pos×Vel pair query wrapper.

Concrete plugs mirror the shallow embedded tests: `EcsBtePos{x,y}` type id 401, `EcsBteVel{x,y}`
type id 402, `EcsBtePlayer{team}` type id 403, plus Time/Event defaults for naming parity. The
registry is cap-4 (`reg_type`, `reg_kind`, `reg_store`) and returns component_id == registry slot,
matching the shallow `ComponentInfo.id` usage in tests. TABLE storage_kind 0 is modeled by dense
cap-16 `(entity_id, x, y)` row stores for Pos and Vel; SPARSE_SET storage_kind 1 is modeled by a
cap-16 `(entity_id, team)` store for Player. Entity allocator uses slot 0 reserved (`next_id=1`,
`id <= 0` rejected), so cap-16 yields 15 usable ids before the no-panic sentinel
`EcsBteEntity{id:-1,generation:0}`.

Tuple-return and Vec-return shallow APIs use wrappers: `EcsBteRegister{world, component_id}` for
register metadata, `EcsBteSpawn{world, entity}` for spawn and spawn_bundle, and
`EcsBteSpawnBatch{world,count,entity_id0/entity_gen0,entity_id1/entity_gen1}` for cap-2
spawn_batch_bundle2/3. `EcsBteBundle2` / `EcsBteBundle3` fold shallow `ErasedComponentValue` into
tagged scalar fields (Pos/Vel x/y, Player team), avoiding generics and erased boxes. `EcsBtePairQuery`
replaces `Query<TableErasedPair<A,B>>` with count + flat item slot families `(entity_id,a_x,a_y,b_x,b_y)`.

Public surface verified: register_component_metadata, component_id_for_type, kind_for_component,
world_spawn, spawn_bundle2, spawn_bundle3, spawn_batch_bundle2/3, insert_bundle2/3,
insert_bundle2/3_if_new, insert_batch_bundle2/3, insert_batch_bundle2/3_if_new, has/get for
Pos/Vel/Player, entity_archetype_id (bitmask >0 after insertion), and query_pair_auto. The shallow
`drop_uninserted_bundle_value` invokes a drop fn on a boxed raw pointer; the deep values are owned
scalars, so this operation is a no-op while preserving if-new semantics.

Tests (8) — `tests/test_ecs_lib_bundle_table_erased_deep_isolated.sla` (191 lines, panic
143600-143682, codes verified unique locally and globally in 143600-143699). Cover: mirror shallow
bundle3 spawn/insert component sets; mirror shallow bundle2 insert preserving existing Pos; mirror
batch bundle3 overwrite behavior; mirror batch bundle3_if_new preserving existing Pos; spawn-batch
bundle3 wrapper returns both entities and populated world; registry lookup + storage_kind metadata;
cap-16 slot-zero-reserved spawn sentinel; bundle2 Pos+Vel query without Player. SA backend and
default backend both pass 8/8.

KEY Batch 392 finding #1 (medium erased bundle module can deepen without first deepening the
large erased world): `bundle_table_erased` depends on `world_table_erased.sla`, but its embedded
behavior only needs a small erased-world slice. A self-contained deep can implement that slice
faithfully enough for bundle semantics by owning the registry + typed stores directly and by
collapsing `ErasedComponentValue` boxes into tagged scalar fields. This keeps `world_table_erased`
(~6300 lines) deferred while still making forward progress on the medium bundle layer.

KEY Batch 392 finding #2 (TABLE vs SPARSE_SET still matters in the deep): even though the deep
stores concrete scalar fields, it preserves storage metadata: Pos/Vel registered with kind 0 and
Player with kind 1. Tests assert kind metadata and component presence through component ids, while
query_pair_auto only walks the table-backed Pos/Vel stores. This preserves the shallow’s important
semantic distinction without reproducing full table-column/archetype internals.

KEY Batch 392 finding #3 (if-new bundle insert requires drop-path semantics even when drop is a
no-op): shallow `insert_bundle*_if_new` calls `drop_uninserted_bundle_value` when a component is
already present. In the deep the value has no heap/raw pointer, so drop is a no-op, but the branch
still matters because it must NOT overwrite the existing component. Test 4 asserts first entity's
pre-existing Pos stays x=1 while Vel/Player are inserted and the second entity receives all bundle
values.

## Batch 393 — relationship_declaration_deep (DONE 2026-07-13)

`lib/relationship_declaration_deep.sla` (528 lines) mirrors shallow `lib/relationship_declaration.sla`
(223 lines) as a SELF-CONTAINED fixed-cap-16 variant (NO `@import`). The shallow module owns
library-side relationship declaration metadata normally synthesized by derive macros: relationship
id, source component id, target collection component id, target mode (many/one), linked_spawn,
allow_self, ordered, valid, and error_code. The shallow registry is
`Vec<EcsRelationshipDeclaration>`; the deep flattens it into cap-16 declaration slot families
(`relationship_type_id0..15`, `source_component_type_id0..15`, etc.) plus `count`.

The deep keeps all validation semantics: invalid relationship/source/target ids, invalid target
mode, source==target component rejection, and ordered one-to-one rejection. Shallow bool fields
become i32 flags in the deep (`0/1`) to keep test access scalar and avoid bool slot-family edge
cases; constructors still accept bool params for source-level parity and immediately convert them
through `ecs_rel_decl_bool`. Registry registration mirrors shallow control flow: invalid
preserves registry and returns `invalid=1` with original error_code; same relationship id + same
full declaration returns duplicate; same relationship id + different declaration returns
id_collision; distinct id but same source/target pair returns pair_conflict; otherwise insertion
writes the next cap slot. Cap overflow returns an invalid register result without mutating the
registry (deep cap-reject convention, no panic).

Tests (9) — `tests/test_ecs_lib_relationship_declaration_deep_isolated.sla` (113 lines, panic
143700-143783, codes verified unique locally and globally in 143700-143799). Cover: mirror shallow
many declaration flags; one-to-one ordered rejection; invalid id/mode/same-component errors;
unique insert; duplicate declaration; id collision; component pair conflict; invalid declaration
registration; cap-16 overflow reject preserving count. SA backend and default backend both pass 9/9.

KEY Batch 393 finding #1 (derive-like metadata modules are excellent fixed-cap registry targets):
this module has no world mutation, async, fn-pointer system callbacks, or reflect runtime payloads;
its main shallow abstraction is a Vec-backed metadata registry. These modules deepen cleanly by
turning Vec rows into slot families and keeping the validation finite-state machine byte-faithful.

KEY Batch 393 finding #2 (bool slot families should be normalized to i32 flags when tests need
stable scalar access): the shallow uses bool fields, but prior deep conventions prefer scalar
accessors. Using i32 `0/1` flags avoids mixed bool/int assertions and keeps register result flags
uniform with earlier wrapper structs that expose found/ok flags as integers.

Post-batch counts (measured): 494 lib modules | 222 `*_deep.sla` modules | 398 test files |
222 `*_deep_isolated.sla` test files | 90 examples | 6285 `@test` total tests-scoped (6276 ->

## Batch 394 — world_registry_typed_deep (DONE 2026-07-13)

`lib/world_registry_typed_deep.sla` (1101 lines) mirrors shallow `lib/world_registry_typed.sla`
(257 lines) as a SELF-CONTAINED fixed-cap variant (NO `@import`). The shallow composes
`RegistryWorld` + two typed `DynamicComponentStore<A/B>` stores + resource/messages + dynamic query
wrappers; the deep inlines the needed registry sidecar: cap-16 entity allocator, A/B membership
columns with per-slot added/changed ticks, typed A/B value stores, resource slot, cap-16 message
queue, and query wrappers. Component ids are fixed (`A=0`, `B=1`), matching shallow construction
where `registry_typed_world_new` registers A then B into `RegistryWorld`.

The deep preserves shallow tick semantics: `change_tick` starts at 1; insert stamps added+changed;
replace/writeback only updates changed; `*_since` uses strict `stamp > tick`. Pair writeback mirrors
`registry_typed_world_query_pair_mut_a_write`: it writes A at the captured A slot and marks A changed
without changing its added tick. Despawn removes both membership/value stores and pushes the entity id
onto the free list with generation bump. Queries are wrapper structs: `EcsWrtQueryA` for query_a and
query_a_without_b, and `EcsWrtPairQuery` for mutable A/B pair query (entity id, A slot, A/B values).

Tests (6) — `tests/test_ecs_lib_world_registry_typed_deep_isolated.sla` (115 lines, panic
143800-143872, codes verified unique locally and globally in 143800-143899). Cover: mirror shallow
A/B binding and A-without-B filtering; mirror shallow pair writeback with added vs changed tick
assertions; mirror shallow despawn removal; plus remove_a keeps B but removes pair query eligibility;
resource/message lifecycle; cap-16 slot-zero-reserved spawn sentinel. SA backend and default backend
both pass 6/6.

KEY Batch 394 finding #1 (RegistryWorld + typed stores can be decomposed into two independent
layers): shallow keeps membership/ticks in RegistryWorld and values in DynamicComponentStore<A/B>.
The deep bakes both into A/B slot families but still preserves the conceptual split: A/B membership
slots carry eid/added/changed, while A/B value slots carry x/y. This makes query filters operate on
membership and get/write operate on value slots, matching the shallow behavior without requiring the
full `world_registry_deep` layer.

KEY Batch 394 finding #2 (pair writeback needs the A slot, not just the entity): shallow
`PairMutItem<A,B>` captures `Mut<A>{entity, slot, value}`. The deep query wrapper explicitly exposes
`ecs_wrt_pair_query_a_slot_at` so writeback can mutate the exact A slot and stamp changed tick. Tests
exercise this by capturing baseline tick, incrementing, writing `a.x + b.x`, and asserting
`added_since(baseline)==false` but `changed_since(baseline)==true`.

Post-batch counts (measured): 495 lib modules | 223 `*_deep.sla` modules | 399 test files |

## Batch 395 — required_components_dynamic_deep (DONE 2026-07-13)

`lib/required_components_dynamic_deep.sla` (182 lines) mirrors shallow
`lib/required_components_dynamic.sla` (254 lines) as a SELF-CONTAINED fixed-cap variant (NO
`@import`). The shallow models Bevy required-components dynamic registration gaps:
`register_dynamic_with`, `register_by_id`, `RequiredComponentsRegistrator::register_required_by_id`,
`register_required_dynamic_with`, and `components_registrator`. It stores `direct_ids` and `all_ids`
in Vecs; the deep flattens both lists into cap-16 slot families and keeps the same result/accessor
shape using wrapper structs (`EcsReqDynResultDeep`, `EcsReqDynMutResultDeep`, and
`EcsRequiredComponentsRegistratorDynDeep`).

Semantics preserved: duplicate direct registration returns ok=0 with DuplicateRegistration kind 0
without mutating state; success appends to direct order and prepends the component id to `all` order
(depth-first/new requirement first), matching the shallow model. `register_by_id` is an alias of
`register_dynamic_with`; mutator variants return mutated required-components state; registrator
facade records `target_component_id`, exposes `components_next_id`, and stores `last_ok` /
`last_err_kind` after each builder-style call. Cap overflow is a no-panic reject returning ok=0 and
preserving counts.

Tests (7) — `tests/test_ecs_lib_required_components_dynamic_deep_isolated.sla` (92 lines, panic
143900-143963, codes verified unique locally and globally in 143900-143999). Cover: success result
lengths; duplicate direct registration no-op; depth-first all-order prepending; registrator facade
target/components accessor; dynamic_with duplicate last_err recording; out-of-range accessors return
-1; cap-16 overflow reject preserving state. SA backend and default backend both pass 7/7.

KEY Batch 395 finding #1 (shallow model modules without embedded tests still need explicit deep
coverage): `required_components_dynamic.sla` has no shallow `@test`, but its public surface is small
and important. The deep test suite therefore exercises each documented semantic path directly rather
than only mirroring embedded tests.

KEY Batch 395 finding #2 (result+mutator wrapper avoids tuple-return and by-ref ambiguity): the
shallow has separate result-only and mutating builder-style APIs. The deep uses
`EcsReqDynMutResultDeep{required,result}` internally for tests that need both the mutated state and
result flags, while keeping public result-only and mut-only helpers. This preserves explicit state
threading and avoids tuple destructuring.

## Batch 396 — query_dynamic_deep (DONE 2026-07-13)

`lib/query_dynamic_deep.sla` (1337 lines) mirrors shallow `lib/query_dynamic.sla` (277 lines) as a
SELF-CONTAINED fixed-cap query layer over a DynamicWorld-like two-component world. The shallow
imports `world_dynamic.sla`, defines generic `Query<T>`, `Mut<T>`, `EntityItem<T>`,
`PairMutItem<A,B>`, and filter marker wrappers (`With`, `Without`, `Added`, `Changed`); the deep
inlines a cap-16 entity allocator, A/B value stores with added/changed ticks, and query result
wrappers. The first shallow embedded test uses `for item in q`; the deep test rewrites it to
`while i < count` over wrapper accessors.

The deep provides `EcsQdQueryA`, `EcsQdEntityAQuery`, and `EcsQdPairQuery` wrappers. `query_mut_a`
uses the pair-query shape with B fields zeroed so it can still expose entity id, A slot, and A
value for writeback without tuple/struct nesting. `query_mut_a_write` and `query_pair_mut_a_write`
mutate by captured A slot and stamp only changed_t. Added/changed filters use strict `stamp > tick`,
matching dynamic_world semantics.

Tests (5) — `tests/test_ecs_lib_query_dynamic_deep_isolated.sla` (124 lines, panic 144000-144051,
codes verified unique locally and globally in 144000-144099). Cover: mirror shallow read/entity
query with for-in rewritten to while; mutable A writeback; pair query + with/without filters; added
and changed filters; cap sentinel + despawn filtering. SA backend and default backend both pass 5/5.

KEY Batch 396 finding #1 (generic query facade can be represented by a small set of typed wrappers):
the shallow's `Query<T>` covers many item types, but the exercised surface only needs A values,
entity+A items, mutable A items, and pair mutable A/B items. The deep maps these to concrete
wrappers with count + per-index accessors, avoiding generic Vec-backed query storage.

KEY Batch 396 finding #2 (for-in query iteration must be rewritten in tests): the shallow test

## Batch 397 — schedule_table_erased_relationship_deep (DONE 2026-07-13)

`lib/schedule_table_erased_relationship_deep.sla` (302 lines) mirrors the scheduling and relationship
access metadata from shallow `lib/schedule_table_erased_relationship.sla` without importing the full
erased table world or preserving fn-pointer execution. The deep is SELF-CONTAINED and models a
small fixed-cap world (`EcsStrWorld`) plus cap-8 schedule slots. System functions are represented by
stable kind ids (`MOVE`, `REL_COUNT`, `MESSAGE`, `RELATE_FIRST_TWO`) so tests can verify scheduling,
conflict metadata, and execution order without runtime function pointers.

Access metadata is flattened into scalar slot families for component reads/writes, relationship
reads/writes, and resource/message read-write flags. Component/type access helpers share the same
component-id conflict path; relationship access has a separate conflict path; resources and messages
conflict independently on write-vs-read/write. The schedule assigns each added system to the first
non-conflicting batch, records pairwise conflict counts, exposes batch widths and max parallel width,
and returns -1 sentinels for out-of-range kind/batch accessors. Cap overflow ignores the ninth system
without panicking.

Tests (6) — `tests/test_ecs_lib_schedule_table_erased_relationship_deep_isolated.sla` (109 lines,
panic 144100-144172, codes verified unique locally and globally in 144100-144199). Cover: three
non-conflicting systems in one batch with sequential run effects; relationship read/write conflict
batch splitting; planned batch run with type access declarations; resource/message conflict
semantics; out-of-range accessor sentinels; cap-8 overflow no-op. SA backend and default backend
both pass 6/6.

KEY Batch 397 finding #1 (fn-pointer systems can be deepened as stable kind ids): the shallow
schedule stores callable systems, but the behavior under test is conflict declaration and run order.
Kind ids keep execution deterministic and self-contained while preserving the relevant scheduling
semantics.

KEY Batch 397 finding #2 (relationship access needs a separate conflict family): component/type
access can share a single id-list path, but relationship ids must not alias component ids. The deep
keeps relationship read/write slot families separate from component read/write slots and verifies
relationship conflicts independently from messages/resources.

## Batch 398 — schedule_table_erased_observer_deep (DONE 2026-07-13)

`lib/schedule_table_erased_observer_deep.sla` (303 lines) mirrors the observer scheduling and event
access metadata from shallow `lib/schedule_table_erased_observer.sla` without importing the full
erased table world or preserving fn-pointer execution. The deep is SELF-CONTAINED and models a
small fixed-cap world (`EcsStoWorld`) plus cap-8 schedule slots. System functions are represented by
stable kind ids (`MOVE`, `OBS_COUNT`, `MESSAGE`, `TRIGGER_PING`) so tests can verify scheduling,
conflict metadata, and execution order without runtime function pointers.

Access metadata is flattened into scalar slot families for component reads/writes, event reads/writes,
and resource/message read-write flags. Component/type access helpers share the same component-id
conflict path; event access has a separate conflict path; resources and messages conflict
independently on write-vs-read/write. The schedule assigns each added system to the first
non-conflicting batch, records pairwise conflict counts, exposes batch widths and max parallel width,
and returns -1 sentinels for out-of-range kind/batch accessors. Cap overflow ignores the ninth system
without panicking.

Tests (6) — `tests/test_ecs_lib_schedule_table_erased_observer_deep_isolated.sla` (109 lines,
panic 144200-144272, codes verified unique locally and globally in 144200-144299). Cover: three
non-conflicting systems in one batch with sequential run effects; event read/write conflict batch
splitting; planned batch run with type access declarations; resource/message conflict semantics;
out-of-range accessor sentinels; cap-8 overflow no-op. SA backend and default backend both pass 6/6.

KEY Batch 398 finding #1 (observer schedules can reuse the relationship schedule shape with event
access): the shallow observer schedule is structurally parallel to the relationship schedule, but
event read/write access must be a separate conflict family from component access. The deep keeps
event read/write slot families separate and verifies event conflicts independently.

KEY Batch 398 finding #2 (trigger-ping system replaces observer trigger semantics): the shallow
observer schedule triggers observers on event writes, but the behavior under test is conflict
declaration and run order. The TRIGGER_PING kind sets observer_count and observed, keeping execution
deterministic while preserving the relevant scheduling semantics.

Post-batch counts (measured): 499 lib modules | 227 `*_deep.sla` modules | 403 test files |

## Batch 399 — schedule_table_erased_deep (DONE 2026-07-13)

`lib/schedule_table_erased_deep.sla` (426 lines) mirrors the base erased sequential schedule from
shallow `lib/schedule_table_erased.sla` (534 lines) without importing the full erased table world or
preserving fn-pointer execution. The deep is SELF-CONTAINED and models a small fixed-cap world
(`EcsSceWorld`) plus cap-8 schedule slots with per-system and per-schedule condition families.

The shallow uses generic `TableErasedSystem<R,M>` with fn-pointer `run` fields, Vec-backed systems
and batch_ids, and condition kinds (ALWAYS/FALSE/TRUE/TICK_AT_LEAST_THREE). The deep replaces
fn-pointer systems with stable kind ids (MOVE/DOUBLE/INCREMENT_TICK/SET_EVENT), flattens access
metadata into scalar slot families, and stores both per-system and per-schedule conditions as cap-8
scalar families. Access conflicts mirror `table_erased_access.sla` (component read/write + resource/
message conflict semantics).

Features preserved: auto-batch chooser (first non-conflicting batch), conflict counting, batch
widths, max parallel width, sequential run honoring both schedule-level and system-level conditions,
planned run iterating batches in order, and explicit ordering (chain/before/after/in_set) bypassing
the auto-batch chooser. Cap overflow is a no-panic reject. Out-of-range accessors return -1.

Tests (7) — `tests/test_ecs_lib_schedule_table_erased_deep_isolated.sla` (140 lines, panic
144300-144395, codes verified unique locally and globally in 144300-144399). Cover: three
non-conflicting systems in one batch with sequential run effects; component conflict batch splitting;
planned run honoring batch ordering; system-level FALSE condition skips a system; schedule-level
TICK_AT_LEAST_THREE condition skips all systems until tick >= 3; explicit ordering chain/before/
after/in_set with batch assertions; resource/message conflicts and cap-8 overflow sentinel. SA backend
and default backend both pass 7/7.

KEY Batch 399 finding #1 (run conditions can be deepened as scalar condition families): the shallow
stores conditions in a `TableErasedRunConditions` struct with 8 slots on both systems and the
schedule. The deep uses `EcsSceConditions` with c0..c7 and a count, stored per-system in the schedule.
Both per-system and per-schedule conditions are checked before execution, matching the shallow
run/run_planned logic.

KEY Batch 399 finding #2 (explicit ordering helpers bypass the auto-batch chooser): the shallow
chain/before/after/in_set functions assign systems to explicit batch ids. The deep models this with
`ecs_sce_schedule_add_system_in_batch` which takes an explicit batch_id, and chain uses
`batch_count` as the next sequential batch, before uses `target-1`, and after uses `target+1`.

=== Batch 400: app_type_registry_deep (completed) ===

Module: lib/app_type_registry_deep.sla (340 lines), mirrors lib/app_type_registry.sla (241 lines).
Self-contained fixed-cap (cap-8) type/function descriptor registries. No @import.
The shallow uses Vec-backed TypeDescriptor/FunctionDescriptor registries with TypeData.
The deep flattens Vec-backed registries to scalar slot families (n0..n7, size_id0..size_id7,
type_id0..type_id7, data0..data7, etc.) with a count, preserving all public API semantics.
Result wrapper structs preserved: EcsAtrTypeDescriptorResult, EcsAtrTypeDataResult,
EcsAtrFunctionDescriptorResult. Cap-reject public ops return sentinel wrappers (not panic).

KEY Batch 400 finding #1 (@derive(copy) required for by-value structs): all 7 structs in the deep
module use @derive(copy). This is essential because structs are passed by-value to helper functions
(find_index, _set_slot, etc.). Without @derive(copy), SLA move semantics consume the value on the
first by-value pass, causing UseAfterMove/PhiStateConflict/CapabilityMismatch backend errors.
@derive(copy) makes by-value passing a copy instead of a move.

KEY Batch 400 finding #2 (cap-reject returns sentinel, not panic): public register/register_or_replace
ops that exceed cap return a sentinel result wrapper (found=false, type_id=0) rather than panicking.
Internal _set_slot panics on cap overflow (defensive), but public ops handle it gracefully.

=== Batch 401: system_trait_deep (completed) ===

Module: lib/system_trait_deep.sla (218 lines), mirrors lib/system_trait.sla (101 lines).
Self-contained System trait + SystemStateFlags + RunSystemOnce + RunSystemError. No @import.

KEY Batch 401 finding #1 (nested struct fields cause SA MemoryLeak even with @derive(copy)):
the first version stored flags as a nested EcsSystemStateFlagsDeep struct inside EcsSystemDeep.
Even with @derive(copy) on both, passing EcsSystemDeep by-value to helper functions (name, is_initialized,
etc.) caused SA backend MemoryLeak "live registers remain at function exit" with a register pointing to
the nested struct field. The fix: flatten the nested struct into a scalar bitfield (flags_bits: i32)
directly inside EcsSystemDeep, matching the system_trait_extras_deep pattern (which used flat scalar
fields and never leaked). This is a likely SA compiler bug — nested-copy struct ownership leaks — but
the workaround (flatten) is clean and avoids hitting it.

KEY Batch 401 finding #2 (tuple return replaced by wrapper struct):
shallow ecs_system_run returns a (EcsSystem, i64) tuple accessed as r.1.
Deep uses EcsSystemRunResult { flags_bits, name_id, last_run_value } with accessors. Likewise shallow
ecs_run_system_once reads r.1; deep uses ecs_system_run_deep_result_output(run_result).

KEY Batch 401 finding #3 (all structs need @derive(copy) when passed by-value repeatedly):
all four structs in the deep module use @derive(copy). Without it, passing the same value to one helper
then referencing it again triggers UseAfterMove.

no docs/issue.md was filed. File only if a future module has no clean flatten workaround.

=== Next Batch 402 candidate prioritization ===
Top candidates (small self-contained, no @import, non-async/non-parallel, non-reflect):
1. entity_index_set_iter_extras (320 lines, no imports, Vec<i64>-only, 16 structs): nested wrappers
   need flattening; ~600+ lines of deep. SA nested-struct MemoryLeak bug means wrappers like
   EcsEis3RangeResult/EcsEis3InsertResult may need flat-field inlining or careful @derive(copy)
   use. Verify with single-test trials before committing.
2. schedule_value (406 lines, no imports, 7 structs each with Vec<i64> fields): large flat-field
   cap module, no nested structs in public result wrappers — likely clean if @derive(copy).
3. world_registry (318 lines, imports component.sla + entity_dynamic.sla): defer; depends on
   two shallow modules without deep counterparts yet.

Pick entity_index_set_iter_extras first since the pattern is closest to existing
entity_index_set_extras deep; if SA MemoryLeak blocks the nested wrappers, switch to schedule_value.

=== Batch 402: entity_index_set_iter_extras_deep (completed) ===

Module: lib/entity_index_set_iter_extras_deep.sla (979 lines), mirrors lib/entity_index_set_iter_extras.sla (320 lines).
Self-contained fixed-cap (cap-8) EntityIndexSet bound/inner/iter/into_iter/drain/set-op-iter/splice extras. No @import.

KEY Batch 402 finding #1 (all structs need @derive(copy)): every struct (Set, Slice, InnerInfo,
InsertResult, RangeResult, Iter, IntoIter, drain structs, OpIter structs, drain/splice result
wrappers) carries @derive(copy). Without it, passing the same Set to helper functions in a
loop triggers SA backend PhiStateConflict. Adding @derive(copy) makes those by-value passes
copies, so no per-iteration move/owning occurs and the loop phi is consistent.

KEY Batch 402 finding #2 (nested struct wrappers flattened to scalar slot families):
all wrapper structs in the shallow (InsertResult{inserted, set}, RangeResult{has, slice},
IterNext{iter, has, value}, DrainResult{set, drain}, SpliceResult{set, removed}) embed
nested Set/Slice/Iter sub-structs. In deep these wrappers store the constituent fields inline
rather than nesting a SetDeep, avoiding the SA MemoryLeak bug reported at docs/issue.md
(reproduced in Batch 401 with a nested EcsSystemStateFlagsDeep).

KEY Batch 402 finding #3 (stateful iterator stepping requires from_next helpers): the deep
uses a function-style front-pointer model with flat Next wrappers. Stepping two ahead requires
reconstructing the inner Iter from the Next wrapper — provided by ecs_eis3_deep_iter_next_from_next
(and analogous _from_next for IntoIter and OpIter). Tests use these _from_next steppers.

KEY Batch 402 finding #4 (drain clamping matches shallow): _ecs_eis3_drain_clamped duplicates the
shallow ecs_eis3_drain_clamped logic (split ranges into kept vs. drained slots) and returns
the flattened DrainResult with both kept_slice and drained_slice fields inlined.

=== Batch 403: schedule_value_deep (completed) ===

Module: lib/schedule_value_deep.sla (751 lines), mirrors lib/schedule_value.sla (406 lines).
Self-contained fixed-cap (cap-16) Schedule value struct + lifecycle API. No @import.

KEY Batch 403 finding #1 (nested EcsScheduleExecutable flattened inline): the shallow module
nested an EcsScheduleExecutable struct inside EcsSchedule (s.executable.system_ids.push(...)).
Per docs/issue.md, nested @derive(copy) struct field access leaks on the SA backend; the deep
version flattens the executable's slot families (sys_ids_0..sys_ids_15, sys_cc_*, sys_lr_*,
sys_ct_*, set_ids_*, set_cc_*) and its built counts directly into EcsScheduleDeep.

KEY Batch 403 finding #2 (tuple returns replaced by separate flat wrappers): every tuple
return in shallow is replaced by a dedicated flat @derive(copy) wrapper struct:
- EcsScheduleInitResultDeep, EcsScheduleCheckChangeTicksResultDeep, EcsScheduleRunResultDeep,
  EcsScheduleApplyDeferredResultDeep, EcsScheduleSystemsResultDeep (with inlined slots),
  EcsScheduleSystemsLenResultDeep, EcsScheduleCleanupOutcomeDeep, EcsScheduleCleanupResultDeep.

KEY Batch 403 finding #3 (initialize must mirror shallow's combined return): shallow
ecs_schedule_initialize returns (Schedule, bool) — the Schedule copy has executor_initialized
set. Deep's ecs_schedule_deep_initialize returns the InitResult summary only (loses the
mutated copy). Add ecs_schedule_deep_initialize_inplace(s) -> EcsScheduleDeep so tests can
chain subsequent calls on the initialized schedule.

KEY Batch 403 finding #4 (SLA else-block syntax): if-else blocks and single-line `if cond { ... }`
forms must close with `};`. Initially several single-line `if out_idx == N { temp = cur; }`
forms missed the trailing `;` — fixed by adding `;`.

KEY Batch 403 finding #5 (bools as i32): the deep stores graph_changed, apply_final_deferred,
executor_initialized, and build_settings_auto_insert as i32 (0/1) rather than bool, simplifying
scalar-slot mutation. Accessor functions convert with `!= 0`.

KEY findings recap:
1. SLA `while { ... }` loops must close with bare `}` (not `};`); only `if`/`else` close with `};`.
   Four `while` closers in this file were originally `};` and had to be adjusted.
2. Vec<i32> entity slice → EcsQsEntityArgDeep { e0..e15, en } + push/at/len accessor helpers.
3. Tuple returns → EcsQsTryNewResultDeep, EcsQsSpawnResultDeep, SingleResultDeep, GetResultDeep,
   GetManyResultDeep, IterManyResultDeep (all @derive(copy), flat fields).
4. Aliased_idx in GetManyResultDeep holds the duplicate entity-id (0 for [0,0]); tests assert
   against the actual dup value, not -1.
5. Iterative mutation uses `let r = spawn(s, v); let s2 = spawn_result_state(r);` two-line
   chaining because spawn returns a wrapper (not the bare state). Direct assignment produces
   TypeMismatch.

=== Batch 405: query_access_iter_extras_deep (completed) ===

Module: lib/query_access_iter_extras_deep.sla (473 lines), mirrors lib/query_access_iter_extras.sla (324 lines).
Self-contained fixed-cap (cap-16) EcsAccessType/EcsAccessLevel/AccessConflictError + is_compatible matrix. No @import.

KEY findings recap:
1. SA MemoryLeak recurred for nested @derive(copy) wrapper:
   AccessIsCompatibleResultDeep { ok, conflict: EcsAccessConflictErrorDeep } flushed through 6
   accessor reads in a single test hits `MemoryLeak: live registers remain at function exit` on
   the SA backend. Same SA bug as docs/issue.md (Batch 401). Fix: flatten the conflict's fields
   directly into the wrapper. docs/issue.md Addendum appended with the recurrence + fix.
2. Vec<i32> reads/writes → EcsAccIdListDeep (cap-16 i32 slot family {v0..v15, vn} + new/push/
   at/len/contains), and the access type itself stores r0..r15+rn and w0..w15+wn directly.
3. `bool` flagged `read_all`/`write_all` stored as i32 0/1; helpers use `!= 0`.
4. Access-vs-Component explicit symmetric branches kept (not normalized) for observable
   ordering in tests (Read-cid-write, Write-cid-read, plus r3 regression: write-vs-write is ok
   on the Access side when the Access has no read).
5. `_ecs_borrowed_access_deep_is_compatible` writes-overlap-reads-or-writes + read_all/write_all
   propagation mirrors Access::is_compatible.

=== Batch 406: system_registry_template_deep (completed) ===

Module: lib/system_registry_template_deep.sla (603 lines), mirrors lib/system_registry_template.sla (312 lines).
Self-contained fixed-cap (cap-16) system-registry templates + CachedSystemRegistry. No @import.

KEY findings recap:
1. SA MemoryLeak recurred for tuple-replacement wrappers that nested the cap-16 container —
   repeated register/cached_register_result access on the SA backend leaked. Same SA bug as
   docs/issue.md (Batch 401 & 405). Fix generalised: flatten each wrapper's tuple-companion value
   directly into the mutated container struct; the mutating fn returns the container (not a
   wrapper), and `last_*` accessors expose the companion (last_registered_entity /
   last_unregister_success / last_run_with_entity / last_run_with_input on the registry;
   last_allocated_entity on the context; last_build_entity on the template).
2. Nested structs flattened inline: EcsSystemHandleValue.inner -> EcsSystemHandleValueDeep's
   inner_kind / inner_handle / inner_has_system_value / inner_system_id; EcsSystemHandleTemplate.value
   -> EcsSystemHandleTemplateDeep's value_ref_count / value_inner_*; EcsTrackedSystem's two nested
   one-field structs -> EcsTrackedSystemDeep's system_entity + despawner_entity.
3. Vec<i32>/Vec<i64> parallel arrays -> cap-16 scalar slot families on EcsCachedSystemRegistryDeep
   (t0..t15 + tn + e0..e15); helpers `_ecsr_type_at/_ent_at/_type_set/_ent_set` indirection;
   cap-16 enforced at register; unregister compacts the live slots.
4. Booleans stored as i32 0/1; accessors use `!= 0`.
5. EcsSystemId and EcsRegisteredSystemDespawner kept as one-field i64 wrappers (safe — small enough
   that the leak does not trigger). Their mk/entity helpers still serve the test surface.

# Batch 407 — `lib/schedule_node_sets_deep.sla` (523-line shallow original)

Source: vw/lib/schedule_node_sets.sla (no `@import`) →
`lib/schedule_node_sets_deep.sla` (1360 lines after fixing the broken body).
Helpers: flat-field slot families; no `Vec<...>`, no nested `@derive(copy)`
struct fields inside the public structs (only scalar inline families and
inline `last_*` companion fields on the mutated container structs). The
flattening strictness is the Batch 401/405/406 anti-MemoryLeak style carried
verbatim into this batch. The only wrapper is `AccessConflictsResultDeep`,
which is a plain flat 6-field return struct (no container mutation happens
through it), so it stayed struct-shaped without leaking.

Lib deep code status (validation on 2026-07-13):
- `_essa_contains_wc` had been left in a broken state by the prior batch
  pickup: its body was the entire prior body of
  `ecs_system_access_deep_get_conflicts`, and so referenced `b`, `n`,
  `out0`, `out1`, `out2`, `out3`, `j` (all unbound in the helper's scope).
  The body was replaced with the simple linear `while i < a.wcn { if
  _essa_wc_at(a, i) == v { return true; }; i = i + 1; } return false;`
  pattern that mirrors `_essa_contains_rc` exactly; the broken
  `if n == X { ... }; ...` chain was relocated into
  `ecs_system_access_deep_get_conflicts` (which was also rewritten as a
  clean pair of `while` loops with sequential `if n == X { ... };` arms).
- The compile blocker that surfaced as `UndefinedVariable: identifier 'b'
  is not defined in this scope` is a diagnostic-quality issue (see docs/
  issue.md addendum): the SLA type checker only surfaces the *first*
  unbound identifier found in a function and emits no file path / line /
  column, even when several names are equally missing at the same site.

### Structures

- `EcsNodeSetEntryDeep` (flat: `system_id: i32`, `system_name: i64`,
  `is_exclusive: i32`) — direct parallel of the original `EcsNodeSetEntry`.
- `EcsNodeSetCondDeep` (flat: `condition_id: i32`) — direct parallel of
  the original `EcsNodeSetCond`.
- `EcsNodeSetSystemsDeep` (cap-16 entries; entries 0..15 via inline
  sid/sname/sxc/per-entry cap-16 conds0/conds1 + cap-16 uninit/init slot
  lists; companion `last_insert_key`, `last_get_found`,
  `last_get_entry_system_id`, `last_get_entry_system_name`,
  `last_get_entry_is_exclusive`, `last_remove_found`).
  `insert`, `get`, `set_system`, `has_conditions`, `condition_count`,
  `add_condition`, `remove`, `is_initialized`, `uninit_count`, `initialize`.
  Only `conds0/conds1` are tracked (cap-16 cond list exists for entries 0..1
  only); `add_condition` returns `s` unchanged when `key >= 2`. That
  matches the shallow original (which only stores conds for the first two
  entries); subsequent entries cannot receive conditions. This is the
  documented behaviour and is preserved.
- `EcsNodeSetConflictingSystemsDeep` (cap-16 (a,b) pairs + per-item cap-16
  conflict-id families for items 0..2 (cf0/cf1/cf2 slot families with
  `_escs_cf_at/_set/_push` helpers); cap-16 enforced at push; `_escs_cf_n_at`
  returns 0 past item 2; push still increments `item_count` past item 2 but
  leaves the conflict-count family untouched). `get` writes to `last_get_a`,
  `last_get_b`, `last_get_conflict_count` (no per-item index stored — get
  returns the just-read values through the same container). `push`,
  `check_if_not_empty`, `to_string_count`.
- `EcsNodeSetSystemAccessDeep` (cap-16 read_components / write_components)
  with read-write access helpers `_essa_rc_at/_set`, `_essa_wc_at/_set`,
  `contains_rc`, `contains_wc`, plus `reads_all` / `writes_all` flags.
  `add_read`, `add_write`, `set_reads_all`, `set_writes_all`, and
  `ecs_system_access_deep_get_conflicts(a, b)` returning a flat
  `AccessConflictsResultDeep {is_individual, conflict_count, cf0..cf3}`.
- `AccessConflictsResultDeep` (flat: `is_individual: i32`,
  `conflict_count: i32`, `cf0..cf3: i32`) — the result-bag for
  `get_conflicts`; reads go through `is_individual`, `count`, `cf(slot)`.
  `is_individual = 0` when any "writes_all / reads_all vs writes_all /
  writes_all vs reads_all" all-vs-all branch fires; the conflict ids are
  not enumerated in that case (count stays 0). Otherwise `is_individual = 1`
  and the per-component pairing runs.
- `EcsNodeSetSystemSetsDeep` (cap-16 sets via `set_id0..15`,
  `is_st0..15`, `ids_map0..15`; cap-16 uninit2 slot list (key, start, end
  triples); companion `last_get_or_insert_key`, `last_contains`,
  `last_get_index`). `get_key_or_insert` (uses `ids_map` linear scan),
  `contains`, `get_index`, `get_set_id`, `set_is_system_type`,
  `get_is_system_type`, `is_initialized`, `uninit_count`, `initialize`.
  `keys` and `(start, end)` ranges are stored per-entry on uninit2; this
  batch does not need them because the deep fixture sets `uninit2_n = 0`
  directly, so `is_initialized` returns `true` out of the box.
- `EcsSystemTypeSetAmbiguityErrorDeep` (flat: `key: i32`).

docs/issue.md carries an additional addendum from this batch, recording an
*unrelated* SLA compiler diagnostic-quality issue: the type checker's
`UndefinedVariable` only surfaces the first unbound identifier (not every
one in the same scope), and emits no file/line/column info, so debugging
the broken `_essa_contains_wc` body required running `sa sla check` once
per missing name. A standalone `repro_diag.sla` reproducer is included in
the addendum.

# Batch 408 — `lib/reflect_component_deep.sla` (92-line shallow original)

Source: vw/lib/reflect_component.sla (no `@import`, 92 lines) →
`lib/reflect_component_deep.sla` (241 lines).
The shallow module models Bevy `ReflectComponent`: a `(entity -> value)` map
plus ComponentId, exposing `find/insert/apply/apply_or_insert_mapped/remove/
take/contains/reflect/copy/id`. The shallow version uses `Vec<i64>` parallel
arrays for entities and entity_values and *tuple-returning* fns:
- `remove: (EcsReflectComponent, bool)`
- `take: (EcsReflectComponent, bool, i64)`
- `reflect: (bool, i64)`
plus `copy` which relies on the tuple return of `reflect`.

Deep strategy: cap-16 parallel `entity{0..15}` and `value{0..15}` slot
families with `_ercd_entity_at/_set`, `_ercd_value_at/_set` indirection
helpers; cap enforced on the new-slot insert path (17th new entity is
dropped silently). The three tuple-returning fns flatten their tuple
companions inline into `EcsReflectComponentDeep`:
- `remove` writes `last_remove_success: i32`; `ecs_reflect_component_deep_last_remove_success`
  is the accessor.
- `take` writes `last_take_success: i32` + `last_take_value: i64`;
  `last_take_success` and `last_take_value` read them.
- `reflect` writes `last_reflect_present: i32` + `last_reflect_value: i64`;
  `last_reflect_present` and `last_reflect_value` read them.
`copy` reuses `reflect`'s companions (reads `last_reflect_present` +
`last_reflect_value`, then inserts into `dest`).
Booleans stored as i32 (0/1); accessors use `!= 0`. `find` keeps returning
`i32` (returns `(0 - 1)` for not-found), no struct wrapper required.

### Structure

- `EcsReflectComponentDeep` (flat: `component_id: i32` + cap-16 parallel
  `entity{0..15}`/`value{0..15}` pairs + `count: i32` + tuple-companion
  fields `last_remove_success`, `last_take_success`, `last_take_value`,
  `last_reflect_present`, `last_reflect_value`).

# Batch 409 — `lib/reflect_misc_deep.sla` (100-line shallow original)

Source: vw/lib/reflect_misc.sla (no `@import`, 100 lines) →
`lib/reflect_misc_deep.sla` (151 lines).
The shallow module groups five Bevy ECS reflect::misc structures:
ReflectEvent, ReflectMessage, FromWorld, ReflectMapEntities, ReflectEntityCommands.
The shallow version uses `Vec<i32>` for `commands` on `ReflectEntityCommands` only;
the other structs are already purely scalar (1 or 2 fields). No tuple-returning
fns; no nested `@derive(copy)` struct fields.

# Batch 410 — `lib/reflect_resource_deep.sla` (87-line shallow original)

Source: vw/lib/reflect_resource.sla (no `@import`, 87 lines) →
`lib/reflect_resource_deep.sla` (202 lines).
The shallow module models Bevy `ReflectResource`: register/insert/get/remove/
apply_or_insert by ComponentId, with parallel `Vec<i32>` (registered_ids) +
`Vec<i64>` (insert_counts) arrays plus `is_registered` linear scan. The shallow
`get(component_id) -> (bool, i64)` returns a tuple, and `insert_count` /
`apply_or_insert` rely on `get`'s tuple return (`g.1`).

Deep strategy: cap-16 parallel `rid{0..15}` (i32) and `ic{0..15}` (i64)
slot families with `_errd_rid_at/_set`, `_errd_ic_at/_set`. The `(bool, i64)`
tuple of `get` is flattened into the struct as `last_get_present: i32` and
`last_get_count: i64`; accessors
`ecs_reflect_resource_deep_last_get_present` / `_last_get_count` read them.
`insert_count` and `apply_or_insert` are direct struct methods using the
companion fields rather than tuple destructuring.

### Structure

- `EcsReflectResourceDeep` (cap-16 `rid{0..15}` + `ic{0..15}` parallel pairs
  + `count: i32` + tuple-companion `last_get_present: i32`,
  `last_get_count: i64`).

# Batch 411 — `lib/reflect_type_data_deep.sla` (98-line shallow original)

Source: vw/lib/reflect_type_data.sla (no `@import`, 98 lines) →
`lib/reflect_type_data_deep.sla` (110 lines).
The shallow module collects four Bevy ECS reflect::type_data sub-types:
ReflectFromWorld, ReflectEvent, ReflectMapEntities, and ReflectCommandExt.
The shallow versions wrap nested `*Fns` structs (`EcsReflectFromWorld {
fns: EcsReflectFromWorldFns }`, `EcsReflectEvent { fns: EcsReflectEventFns }`),
and access goes `r.fns.from_world_fn`, which triggers the SA MemoryLeak
documented in docs/issue.md. The deep module flattens those nested Fns
structs inline into the wrapper dicts:
- `EcsReflectFromWorldDeep { from_world_fn: i64 }`
- `EcsReflectEventDeep { trigger_fn, create_observer_fn, register_event_key_fn }`
- `EcsReflectMapEntitiesDeep { map_entities_fn: i64 }`
- `EcsReflectCommandDeep { kind, type_path_handle, component_handle }`
The `_fns_new` helpers remain (returning the flattened wrapper itself), and the
`*_fn_pointers` accessor returns the wrapper struct directly. No tuple-returning
fns; no slot families (no Vec); no internal panic guards.

### Structures

- `EcsReflectFromWorldDeep` (`from_world_fn: i64`); `fns_new`, `new`,
  `from_world` (read field), `fn_pointers` (returns self).
- `EcsReflectEventDeep` (`trigger_fn`, `create_observer_fn`,
  `register_event_key_fn` `i64`); `fns_new`, `new`, `trigger`,
  `create_observer`, `register_event_key`, `fn_pointers`.
- `EcsReflectMapEntitiesDeep` (`map_entities_fn: i64`); `new`, `call`.
- `EcsReflectCommandDeep` (`kind: i32`, `type_path_handle: i64`,
  `component_handle: i64`); `insert(0,..)`, `remove(1,..,0)`, `take(2,..,0)`,
  `kind`, `type_path`, `component`, `is_insert`, `is_remove`, `is_take`.

docs/issue.md remains at its Batch 407 close. The Batch 401/406
nested-struct-flatten pattern (accessing fields of nested @derive(copy)
struct fields leaks on SA backend) was exercised again: the deep version of
this batch flat-inlined the Fns-companion fields into each wrapper and the
SA backend passed on the first try, confirming the workaround is necessary
and sufficient.

`Vec<i32>` `component_ids` it contains, with id/add_component/count/at/
insert(returns count)/is_registered accessors.

# Batch 414 — `lib/world_extras_deep.sla` (612-line shallow original)

Source: vw/lib/world_extras.sla (no `@import`, 612 lines) →
`lib/world_extras_deep.sla` (1271 lines after extensions).
The shallow module's own header notes that it uses result-shim structs because
"the SA backend corrupts the .1 slot of `(i32,i32)` tuples returned from lib
fns." Eight main module structs plus five flat result shim structs (ReqComp /
ReqQuery / ReqNth / ResourceGet / QueueAt) plus variant enumeration helpers.
The shallow version drives `Vec<i32>` parallel arrays (requiree_ids,
required_ids, constructor_ids, registered_component_ids, archetyped_ids, free_
indices, spawned_indices, spawned_types, component_ids, entity_indices,
queued_type_ids, queued_storage_kinds, e.g. 12 distinct array slot families)
plus three unwind wrapper structs nest an operational sibling struct
(RegisterResult { registry, result }, AllocResult { alloc, idx, generation },
QueueApplyResult { queue, applied }, SpawnAtResult { facade, ... },
SpawnBatchResult { facade, count, first }, ModifyResult { facade, ... },
ModifyResourceResult { resources, facade, ... }): the Batch 401/406/411
nested-@derive(copy)-struct-field leak applies.

Deep strategy:
- Replace every `Vec<i32>` with a cap-16 i32 slot family + count + helpers
  (`_xxx_at`, `_xxx_set`, `_xxx_push`, plus `_xxx_remove_at` for the spawn/
  spawned compaction paths and inline backshift `pop_front` for the queue
  front-removal helpers).
- The mutation-returning wrapper fn (RegisterResult/AllocResult/QueueApplyResult
  /SpawnAtResult/SpawnBatchResult/ModifyResult/ModifyResourceResult) all return
  the *mutated container* directly, with the tuple companion stashed into the
  container's `last_*` inline fields (Batch 406 pattern). The five flat result
  shim structs (ReqComp/ReqQuery/ReqNth/ResourceGet/QueueAt) stay struct-shaped
  — they hold only scalar i32 fields; no operational struct field, no leak
  trigger. The accessor fns read the companions in both directions.
- The EcsWorldSpawnFacade embeds the EcsWorldEntityAllocator fields inline
  (not nested as a separate struct field), to also dodge the nested-struct leak.
- `spawn_batch(type_ids: Vec<i32>)` is reshaped into two-step caller API
  (spawn_batch_step + spawn_batch_finish) because SLA fns cannot take a
  Vec<i32> param in this deepening style; each `spawn_batch_step(f, type_id)`
  allocation lines up with the allocator's next free index and the parallel
  spawned_types slot.
- `_remove_at` (compact-backshift) for `EcsWorldEntityAllocator.spawned_indices`
  is the deep mirror of the shallow `spawned_indices.remove(i)`. `_apply` uses a
  per-item pop_front (compact-backshift) loop to drain the queued arrays in
  order.

### Structures & helpers

- `EcsWorldRequiredRegistryDeep` (5 cap-16 i32 slot families: req, rid, cid,
  reg, arc — for the requiree/required/constructor/registered_component/
  archetyped parallel data — plus req_n/rid_n/cid_n/reg_n/arc_n counts plus
  the tuple-replacement `last_register_ok/kind/a/b`, `last_query_found/count`,
  `last_nth_found/required_id/constructor_id`). 5 `_xxx_at` + 1 `_reg_set` +
  push helpers.
- `EcsWorldEntityAllocatorDeep` (next_index, generation, cap-16 fi + cap-16
  si families + fi_n/si_n counts + `last_alloc_idx/generation`). Removal helpers
  (`_si_remove_at`) and pop-front helpers for `free_indices`.
- `EcsWorldResourceEntitiesDeep` (cap-16 cid + eid parallel families + count +
  `last_get_found/entity_idx`).
- `EcsWorldSpawnFacadeDeep` (inlined allocator fields — next_index,
  generation, fi slot family, si slot family, fi_n/si_n, + cap-16 spawned_
  types + tuple companions for alloc/spawn_at/spawn_batch/modify/last_*).
- `EcsWorldComponentsQueueDeep` (cap-16 qt + sk parallel families + count +
  `last_at_found/type_id/storage_kind` + `last_apply_applied`).
- `EcsUnsafeWorldCellDeep` (world_ptr: i64, readonly: i32 — scalar mirror).
- 5 flat result-shim structs (ReqComp/ReqQuery/ReqNth/ResourceGet/QueueAt),
  plain @derive(copy) scalar dicts.
- Variant enums as const helpers / predicate fns on the populated companions:
  `ecs_req_err_kind_deep`, `ecs_req_ok_placeholder_deep`, `ecs_spawn_err_*`,
  `ecs_entity_fetch_err_*`, `ecs_register_result_deep_is_dup/cyclic/

No easy shallow `lib/*.sla` candidates remain for further shallow deepening.
docs/issue.md updated with a Batch 415 addendum describing the SA backend
ForbiddenSyntax flattening regression affecting every deep-iso test in the
repo (a toolchain issue, not specific to Batch 415).


# Batch 416 — `lib/reflect_deep.sla` (99-line shallow original) — DONE

Source: `lib/reflect.sla` (trait `EcsReflect` + `EcsReflectComponentFns`
fn-pointer table over `ErasedComponentValue`). Target:
`lib/reflect_deep.sla` (self-contained, no `@import`).

Deep strategy: fold `ErasedComponentValue` into flat
`EcsReflectValueDeep { type_id, raw }`; model `EcsReflect::reflect_type_id`
with stable scalar type ids; flatten the Bevy-shaped `ReflectComponentFns`
table into `EcsReflectComponentFnsDeep` with i64 fn handles; flatten the
wrapper into `EcsReflectRootComponentDeep` instead of nesting the fn table.
The deep dispatch helpers return deterministic handle+argument results for
`insert`, `apply`, `remove`, `take`, `contains`, `reflect`, `copy`, and
`register_component`, proving wrapper/fn-table routing without relying on
runtime dyn reflect or actual callback execution.

Test file: `tests/test_ecs_lib_reflect_deep_isolated.sla` (10 `@test`

Next free panic band: 147670+ (Batch 416 used tests 147630-147658).
Remaining shallow lib files without a deep counterpart are task/async/parallel:
`parallel_scope`, `task_scope_executor_drive`, `executor_single_threaded`,
and `executor_multi_threaded`. Root `reflect` is now deep-covered through the
flat handle-dispatch model; full runtime reflection remains intentionally
outside scope per README/current plan.


# Batch 417 — `lib/parallel_scope_deep.sla` (105-line shallow original) — DONE

Source: `lib/parallel_scope.sla` (Bevy `ParallelCommands` /
`ParallelCommandQueue` model using `Vec<i64>` command and thread-id arrays).
Target: `lib/parallel_scope_deep.sla` (self-contained, no `@import`).

Deep strategy: replace both Vec arrays with cap-16 scalar slot families and
model insertion-order command recording, per-thread counts, per-thread command
filtering via `last_get*` companion slots, clear/is_empty, and cap enforcement.
`EcsParallelCommandsDeep` was initially implemented with a nested
`EcsParallelCommandQueueDeep`, but SA backend reported the known nested-copy
struct MemoryLeak pattern. The final version flattens queue slots directly
inside `EcsParallelCommandsDeep` and uses temporary conversion helpers for
shared queue logic, so both SA and default backends pass.

# Batch 418 — `lib/task_scope_executor_drive_deep.sla` (178-line shallow original) — DONE

Source: `lib/task_scope_executor_drive.sla`, which models Bevy
`TaskPool::scope_with_executor_inner` branch selection over explicit task
counts. Target: `lib/task_scope_executor_drive_deep.sla` (self-contained,
no `@import`, no inline `@test` in the lib).

Deep strategy: preserve the four branch constants and scalar drive algorithm,
add `@derive(copy)` input/result structs, store bool fields as i32 to avoid
backend ownership edge cases, clamp negative input counts to zero, expose a
full result accessor surface, and move coverage into an isolated test file.
The model covers execute-scope, global-scope, external-scope, and
global+external-scope paths, forced pool ticking when worker count is zero,
same-executor external suppression, unrelated global latency accounting, and
executor panic restart accounting.

The immediate shallow-deepening queue is now down to the executor modules:
`executor_single_threaded` and `executor_multi_threaded`.


# Batch 419 — `lib/executor_single_threaded_deep.sla` (563-line shallow original) — DONE

Source: `lib/executor_single_threaded.sla`, the Bevy
`SingleThreadedExecutor` model with Vec-backed evaluated/completed/unapplied
bitsets and run-condition/deferred-error helpers. Target:
`lib/executor_single_threaded_deep.sla` (self-contained, no `@import`).

Deep strategy: replace Vec bitsets with fixed cap-16 scalar slots for
completed systems, unapplied systems, and evaluated sets; keep all executor
state flat to avoid nested-copy struct leaks; preserve apply-final-deferred,
run/skip/process-system, ApplyDeferred barrier, finish-run cleanup,
failed/passed set-condition, initial-skip, system/deferred panic payload,
handled-error, payload take, and condition-fold semantics. Vector-taking
helpers are represented through fixed arity `*_3` / `*_4` facades for the
same scheduling cases.

The immediate shallow-deepening queue is now down to
`executor_multi_threaded`; it is the largest remaining executor model.


# Batch 420 — `lib/executor_multi_threaded_deep.sla` (1348-line shallow original) — DONE

Source: `lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla`, the largest remaining executor
model. Target: `lib/executor_multi_threaded_deep.sla` (self-contained,
no `@import`).

Deep strategy: cover the core `ExecutorState` gate and ready-batch selection
surface with cap-16 scalar slots for ready/running/completed/unapplied
systems and dependency counters. The state remains fully flat to avoid
nested-copy backend leaks. System specs model send/local/exclusive flags plus
up to two access-conflict ids; batch selection chooses up to three ready
systems while honoring completed/dependency gates, local-thread exclusivity,
exclusive system isolation, running-system conflicts, and access conflicts.
Completion marks finished systems, preserves unapplied-deferred state, and
releases local/exclusive gates.

Feature progress: multi-threaded executor core `ExecutorState` gate and
ready-batch sub-surface 0% -> 100%; overall API parity remains ~94–96%,
behavioral parity remains ~86–91%. The immediate no-deep-counterpart queue is
empty; future executor work should extend `executor_multi_threaded_deep` into
completion/tick handoff and broader scheduling facades.


# Batch 421 — `lib/executor_multi_threaded_deep.sla` completion/tick handoff — DONE

Source focus: the `ExecutorState` dependent-release, skipped/evaluated,
deferred-application, finish-run, and completion tick handoff sections of
`lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla`.

Deep strategy: extend the existing flat `EcsExecutorStateDeep` instead of
adding nested run-plan wrappers. Added cap-16 scalar slot families for skipped
systems and evaluated sets; added fixed-arity dependent release and
completion-with-dependents facades; added skip-with-dependents,
mark-skipped-pending, set-evaluated, apply-deferred-one/all, finish-run, and
tick-after-completion-to-ready-batch helpers. The tick helper completes one
running system, releases up to three dependents, and selects the next ready
batch from three candidates while preserving the Batch 420 gate logic.

Feature progress: multi-threaded executor completion/tick handoff sub-surface
0% -> 100% for this flat fixed-arity model; overall API parity remains
~94–96%, behavioral parity remains ~86–91%. Remaining useful work in this
module is higher-level run-plan condition folding/error payload facades if
more executor depth is desired.


# Batch 422 — `lib/executor_multi_threaded_deep.sla` condition/error facades — DONE

Source focus: the `MultiThreadedExecutor` panic/handled-error payload helpers
and `EcsExecutorRunPlan` condition-folding / failed-condition state effects in
`lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla`.

Deep strategy: add flat `EcsExecutorErrorStateDeep` and
`EcsExecutorConditionFoldDeep` structs instead of nesting a full run plan.
The error facade mirrors system/deferred panic payload recording, system/
deferred handled-error recording, phase/system tracking, and panic payload
take/rethrow accounting. The condition facade models Bevy's non-short-circuit
condition fold: false keeps evaluating later conditions, handled errors
become false and keep evaluating, and error-handler panic aborts the fold with
a run-condition panic payload. Added fixed-arity helpers for failed set
conditions, passed set conditions, failed system conditions, and joining set +
system fold results.

Feature progress: multi-threaded executor condition/error facade sub-surface

are broader run-plan drive loops and lock-failure tick wrappers.


# Batch 423 — `lib/executor_multi_threaded_deep.sla` drive/lock-failure summaries — DONE

Source focus: the `EcsExecutorRunPlan` start/take-batch/drive-one/drive-batch
loop and tick-loop lock-failure wrappers in `lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla`.

Deep strategy: extend the flat system spec with `has_deferred`,
`should_run`, and `is_apply_deferred` flags, then add flat
`EcsExecutorDriveSummaryDeep` results rather than nesting full run plans.
New helpers cover next-ready, next-runnable over three candidates,
drive-one run/skip/apply-deferred-barrier summaries, width-limited ready-batch
drive summaries, and lock-failed tick summaries that preserve pending
completion ids and apply-deferred counts. This keeps the executor drive model
fixed-arity and backend-stable while covering the next run-plan layer above
the Batch 420-422 state, handoff, and error facades.

Feature progress: multi-threaded executor drive-loop / lock-failure summary
sub-surface 0% -> 100% for the flat fixed-arity model; overall API parity

would be broader multi-wave tick-loop summaries or full run-plan history
tracking, which would need the same flat-summary approach to stay backend
stable.


# Batch 424 — `lib/executor_multi_threaded_deep.sla` multi-wave tick summaries — DONE

Source focus: the `tick_executor_with_completion_waves`,
`tick_executor_after_system_completed`, and
`retry_pending_completions` metadata behavior in
`lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla`.

Deep strategy: add flat `EcsExecutorTickLoopSummaryDeep` instead of modeling
nested `Vec<Vec<i64>>` completion waves. New fixed-arity helpers cover the
no-completion-waves case (still produces one tick), two completion waves that
complete systems, release dependents, start selected batch systems between
waves, and record per-wave batch summaries, plus retry-pending metadata that
counts the pending wave before later waves. This builds directly on the Batch
423 drive summary surface and keeps all returned data scalar.

`skipped_order` tracking plus their count/at accessors in
`lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla`.

Deep strategy: add flat `EcsExecutorRunHistoryDeep` with capped scalar
run/apply/skipped slots instead of nesting a full run plan. New helpers cover
push/accessor behavior, out-of-range `-1` access, applying current unapplied
systems in ascending system order, recording a ready-batch's selected systems,
and a drive-one facade that records run, skip, stalled, and ApplyDeferred
barrier history metadata.

# Batch 426 — `lib/executor_multi_threaded_deep.sla` drive-all history integration — DONE

Source focus: the `ecs_executor_run_plan_drive_all` loop in
`lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla`, especially repeated next-runnable scans,
dependency release between iterations, skipped-system release, ApplyDeferred
barrier apply ordering, and stalled detection.

Deep strategy: extend the flat run-history layer with a fixed-arity
`ecs_executor_run_history_deep_drive_all3` facade. The helper scans runnable
systems in system-index order, advances the local state internally, releases
per-system dependents through scalar dep triples, records run/apply/skipped
history, applies current unapplied systems before completing an ApplyDeferred
barrier, and sets the stalled bit when a ready system remains blocked by a
running conflict.

Deep strategy: add flat `EcsExecutorDriveAllBatchedIntegrationSummaryDeep` and
fixed-arity `ecs_executor_drive_all_batched_integration_summary_deep3`. The
helper advances at most three scalar waves over the existing three-spec model,
records run/completed/skipped/apply order in flat slots, mutates state only
through scalar helpers, and avoids whole-plan or Vec-backed state. Slot writes
are inline for the same wide-struct stability reason documented in Batch 435.

# Batch 435 — `lib/executor_multi_threaded_deep.sla` drive-ready-batch integration summaries — DONE

Source focus: `ecs_executor_run_plan_drive_ready_batch` in
`lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla`, especially the integration between
ready-batch selection, run-order recording, complete-ready-batch behavior,
skip/dependent release, ApplyDeferred barrier application, and zero-width
stall handling.

Deep strategy: add flat `EcsExecutorDriveReadyBatchIntegrationSummaryDeep` and
fixed-arity `ecs_executor_drive_ready_batch_integration_summary_deep3`. The
helper uses explicit scalar 0/1/2 selection slots, records skipped systems
that release dependents before later slots are considered, delays state
mutation until after selection so adjacent ready send systems are both
selected, then starts/completes selected systems in run order. Wide summary
slot writes are inline in the main helper because prior focused tests showed
second-slot updates through push helpers are unstable for this large flat
struct shape.

# Batch 430 — `lib/executor_multi_threaded_deep.sla` completed-tick error summaries — DONE

Source focus: the completed tick executor wrappers in
`lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla`: system panic/handled-error completion,
ApplyDeferred panic/handled-error completion, and their lock-failed pending
completion variants.

Deep strategy: add flat `EcsExecutorCompletedTickErrorSummaryDeep` plus
fixed-arity helpers for normal completed-tick continuation and lock-failed
pending completion. The helpers combine error payload/handled-error metadata,
ApplyDeferred barrier apply counts, pending completion slots, skipped ready
systems, selected ready systems, and post-tick ready/running/completed/
unapplied counts without nesting executor, tick-loop, or batch structs.

# Batch 431 — `lib/executor_multi_threaded_deep.sla` complete-ready-batch summaries — DONE

Source focus: `ecs_executor_run_plan_complete_ready_batch` in
`lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla`, especially its two-pass behavior: start
selected systems that are not already running, then complete selected systems
in batch order while applying existing deferred buffers before an
ApplyDeferred barrier and releasing dependents after each completion.

Deep strategy: add flat `EcsExecutorCompleteReadyBatchSummaryDeep` and a
fixed-arity `ecs_executor_complete_ready_batch_summary_deep3` helper. The
helper accepts three selected batch slots plus three spec/dependent slot
families, records start/completion/apply order in scalar slots, summarizes
post-batch ready/running/completed/unapplied counts, and reports local/
exclusive gate cleanup without nesting a run plan or ready-batch result.

# Batch 432 — `lib/executor_multi_threaded_deep.sla` initial-skip summaries — DONE

`lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla`, especially initial skipped-system input
handling, invalid/completed skip suppression, skipped-order recording, and
dependent release after each accepted initial skip.

Deep strategy: add flat `EcsExecutorInitialSkipsSummaryDeep` and a fixed-arity
`ecs_executor_initial_skips_summary_deep3` helper. The helper accepts three
initial skip slots plus three spec/dependent slot families, records accepted
and ignored skip ids in scalar slots, uses local completed markers to keep
duplicate skips deterministic, releases dependents for accepted skips, and
summarizes post-skip ready/completed/skipped/dependency slots without nesting
a run plan or Vec-backed skip list.

# Batch 433/434 — `lib/executor_multi_threaded_deep.sla` completion drain/tick summaries — DONE

Source focus: `ecs_executor_run_plan_drain_completion_queue` and
`ecs_executor_run_plan_tick_with_completions` in
`lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla`, especially completion queue ordering,
ApplyDeferred barrier handling before completing the barrier system, duplicate
or invalid completed-system entries, dependent release after accepted
completions, and same-tick ready-batch selection after draining completions.

Deep strategy: add flat `EcsExecutorCompletionQueueDrainSummaryDeep` and a
fixed-arity `ecs_executor_completion_queue_drain_summary_deep3` helper, plus
flat `EcsExecutorTickWithCompletionsSummaryDeep` and
`ecs_executor_tick_with_completions_summary_deep3`. The helpers accept three
queued completion slots plus three spec/dependent slot families, complete only
currently-running systems in queue order, report ignored entries when a queued
id is invalid or no longer running, apply all existing deferred buffers before
completing an ApplyDeferred spec, release dependents through the existing
scalar dependent helpers, and summarize post-drain/tick
ready/running/completed/unapplied/gate/dependency slots without nesting a run
plan, completion queue, or tick-loop result. The no-completion tick path uses
the fixed-arity ready-batch helper directly after a focused failure showed the
generic rescan loop only selected the first ready system when exactly systems
0 and 1 were ready.

# Batch 437 — `lib/executor_multi_threaded_deep.sla` ready-batch/tick-loop accessor parity helpers — DONE

Source focus: shallow accessor parity in `lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla` for
ready batches and tick-loop summaries, especially `_count`, `_at`, local /
exclusive flags, tick count, lock-failed status, pending completions, and
per-batch system accessors.

Deep strategy: add scalar accessor helpers for `EcsExecutorReadyBatchDeep` and
`EcsExecutorTickLoopSummaryDeep` without changing the underlying flat
fixed-arity data model. `ecs_executor_ready_batch_deep_at` now respects the
recorded count before returning slot contents, so stale unused slots report
`-1` consistently with the new pending-completion and batch accessors.

# Batch 438 — `lib/executor_multi_threaded_deep.sla` tick-loop skipped-batch accessor parity — DONE

Source focus: shallow `ecs_executor_ready_batch_skipped_count`,
`ecs_executor_ready_batch_skipped_at`,
`ecs_executor_tick_loop_batch_skipped_count`, and
`ecs_executor_tick_loop_batch_skipped_at` behavior in
`lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla`.

Deep strategy: extend the flat `EcsExecutorTickLoopSummaryDeep` with
per-batch skipped count/id slots for two capped tick waves, add scalar
skipped-batch accessors with count-aware `-1` bounds, and route tick-loop
batch summaries through the existing ready-batch rescan summary so skipped
system ids are preserved alongside selected systems. This fixes a deep helper
gap where tick-loop summaries could expose selected batch systems but had no
way to report systems skipped during the same rescan wave.

# Batch 439 — `lib/executor_multi_threaded_deep.sla` condition-fold/run-history accessor parity — DONE

Source focus: shallow accessor helpers in `lib/executor_multi_threaded.sla`
for condition folds and run-plan history:
`ecs_executor_condition_fold_should_run`,
`ecs_executor_condition_fold_evaluated_count`,
`ecs_executor_condition_fold_aborted`, `ecs_executor_run_plan_run_count`,
`ecs_executor_run_plan_apply_count`, `ecs_executor_run_plan_skipped_count`,
and `ecs_executor_run_plan_is_stalled`.

Deep strategy: add scalar read-only accessors over existing
`EcsExecutorConditionFoldDeep` and `EcsExecutorRunHistoryDeep` fields. This
does not change drive, fold, or history mutation behavior; it closes the
remaining accessor parity gap for these flat summaries so tests and downstream
deep users no longer need direct field reads for counts and stalled/aborted
booleans.

panic/handled-error counts, phase/system fields, and panic payload rethrows.

Deep strategy: add read-only helpers over the existing
